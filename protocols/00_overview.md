# Workflow Protocols — Overview
Part of the IRONBOUND-AI Operator Framework  
Version 1.0 • 2026  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (TB)

## Purpose of This Directory

This directory contains the operational workflows, protocols, and  
multi-model sequences that govern how IRONBOUND-AI is executed in practice.

Where **core-principles** defines the laws, constraints, and conceptual  
foundations of the system, **workflow-protocols** defines:

- how operators activate the system  
- how models interact in defined roles  
- how to prevent and correct drift  
- how to run multi-step, multi-model pipelines  
- how to enforce structure, density, and boundaries  
- how to maintain stability across long sessions  

Together, these protocols form the practical engine of IRONBOUND-AI.
