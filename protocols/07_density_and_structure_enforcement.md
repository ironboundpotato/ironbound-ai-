# Density and Structure Enforcement (v1.1)
Part of the IRONBOUND-AI Operator Framework  
Version 1.1 • 2026  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (TB)

## Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **rules, controls, and enforcement mechanisms**  
for maintaining structural integrity and density consistency  
across all IRONBOUND-AI workflows.

Density and structure form the **operational spine** of the system:

- Structure = the skeleton  
- Density = the depth  
- Constraints = the connective tissue  
- Roles = the muscle groups  
- Workflow sequences = movement patterns  

Without explicit enforcement, generative drift collapses both.

This document ensures:
- controlled depth  
- stable structure  
- predictable reasoning  
- tone and meaning preservation  
- no over-expansion or under-explanation

# Section 1 — What Density Means in IRONBOUND-AI

Density is the **operational depth of explanation**—the “thickness” of reasoning allowed.

Density levels define:
- conceptual complexity  
- abstraction level  
- detail weight  
- interpretive distance  
- reasoning bandwidth  

### **Examples of Density Levels**
- **Density 3** = minimal explanation, high compression  
- **Density 5** = balanced explanation and clarity  
- **Density 6.5** = TB’s canonical sweet spot (framework-grade)  
- **Density 8+** = advanced theoretical expansion  

Density is always set by the operator.  
AI must *never* choose density on its own.

---

# Section 2 — Density Enforcement Rules

### **Rule 1 — Density Must Be Stated Explicitly**
If the operator does not specify density, the AI must request it.

### **Rule 2 — Density Cannot Drift Mid-Workflow**
No increasing detail unless explicitly commanded.  
No simplification unless explicitly commanded.

### **Rule 3 — Density Must Match the Role**
Examples:
- Architect ignores density except for structure depth.  
- Editor respects existing density exactly.  
- Stress Tester critiques density mismatches.  
- Polisher maintains density but improves clarity.

### **Rule 4 — Density Exceeds Tone**
Density governs depth.  
Tone governs emotional weight.  
The two must remain independent.

---

# Section 3 — Structure Enforcement Rules

### **Rule 1 — Architect Structure Is Sacred**
Once created, structure cannot be:
- reordered  
- condensed  
- expanded  
- merged  
- reframed  

Any violation = structural drift.

### **Rule 2 — Operator Alone May Alter Structure**
Models may not restructure content in any role.

### **Rule 3 — All Passes Must Obey Structure**
Editor edits wording, not placement.  
Stress Tester critiques structure, never changes it.  
Polisher smooths language, never rearranges.

### **Rule 4 — Structure Defines the Workflow Path**
No pass may skip, merge, or reinterpret sections.

---

# Section 4 — Density Drift Signals

Density drift may appear as:
- over-explanation  
- extra metaphor  
- excessive compression  
- tone inflation  
- adding examples  
- adding assumptions  
- conceptual sprawl  

When any of these appear → **interrupt.**

---

# Section 5 — Structure Drift Signals

Structure drift may appear as:
- reordered sections  
- re-labeled items  
- merged bullets  
- combined steps  
- added or removed sections  
- collapsed hierarchy levels  
- reinterpreted relationships  

**Any structural deviation requires immediate correction.**

---

# Section 6 — Density Enforcement Templates

### **Template A — Set Density**
```
DENSITY: <value>.
Produce reasoning at this exact depth.
No expansion. No compression.
```

### **Template B — Maintain Density**
```
Maintain density level <value>.
Do not increase or decrease depth.
```

### **Template C — Restore Density**
```
Density drift detected.
Reset to density <value>.
Rewrite only to correct density consistency.
```

---

# Section 7 — Structure Enforcement Templates

### **Template A — Lock Structure**
```
The structure below is locked.
No reordering, merging, expansion, or deletion is allowed.
```

### **Template B — Enforce Structural Fidelity**
```
Maintain the exact structure provided.
Do not reinterpret, summarize, or reorganize.
```

### **Template C — Structure Drift Correction**
```
Structural drift detected.
Restore the original structure precisely.
No new sections. No collapsed hierarchy.
```

---

# Section 8 — Combined Density + Structure Enforcement

Use this when both are critical:

```
STRUCTURE: Locked.
DENSITY: <value>.
ROLE: <role>.
CONSTRAINTS:
- No new ideas
- No reordering
- No tone shifts
- No density changes
- No structural alterations
Perform the assigned role only.
```

This is the highest-fidelity enforcement macro.

---

# Section 9 — Stress Tester Responsibilities for Density + Structure

The Stress Tester must:
- flag density inconsistencies  
- identify overloaded or underdeveloped sections  
- point out structural breaks  
- identify hierarchy mismatches  
- detect tone-drift caused by density-drift  

The Stress Tester must *not* fix these issues—only reveal them.

---

# Section 10 — Why Density + Structure Enforcement Matters

Together, density and structure:
- prevent runaway expansion  
- prevent collapse into vagueness  
- stabilize large documents  
- preserve meaning over revisions  
- allow multi-pass workflows to remain predictable  
- keep AI outputs clean, sharp, and operator-controlled  

Density = depth discipline.  
Structure = shape discipline.  
Constraints = behavioral discipline.  
Roles = execution discipline.  
Lockstep = sequencing discipline.  

This is the spine of IRONBOUND-AI.
