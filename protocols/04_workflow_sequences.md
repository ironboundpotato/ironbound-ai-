# Workflow Sequences (v1.1)
Part of the IRONBOUND-AI Operator Framework  
Version 1.1 • 2026  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (TB)

## Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **authorized workflow sequences** used inside IRONBOUND-AI.  
A workflow sequence is a **repeatable, deterministic path** from operator intent  
to final output, governed by:

- the Bug Bomb Protocol  
- the Ironbound Lockstep Protocol  
- the Seven Immutable Constraints  
- the role definitions  

Each workflow type includes:
- when to use it  
- how it proceeds  
- what each step produces  
- drift risks  
- operator intervention points  

These sequences convert AI interaction into **controlled, auditable engineering processes**.

# Section 1 — Overview of Workflow Categories

IRONBOUND-AI supports four workflow families:

1. **Structural Workflows** — creating outlines, architectures, frameworks  
2. **Refinement Workflows** — improving clarity, logic, and execution  
3. **Diagnostic Workflows** — detecting weaknesses and drift  
4. **Polish Workflows** — final tone and readability passes  

All complex workflows combine these families using Lockstep sequencing.

# Section 2 — Structural Workflow Sequence

Used when the operator needs:
- an outline  
- a framework  
- a system architecture  
- a multi-part document plan  
- a step-by-step model  

### **Sequence**
```
Step 1 — Operator defines intent + constraints  
Step 2 — Architect creates the structure  
Step 3 — Operator validates structure  
Step 4 — Editor clarifies structural wording  
Step 5 — Operator validates clarity  
```

### **Outputs**
- multi-level outline  
- section map  
- logic flow  
- zero prose  

### **Drift Risks**
- Architect adding prose  
- Editor modifying structure  
- Operator skipping validation  

---

# Section 3 — Refinement Workflow Sequence

Used when the structure exists but needs:
- clarity  
- improved logic  
- better articulation  

### **Sequence**
```
Step 1 — Operator provides structure  
Step 2 — Editor refines meaning-preserving clarity  
Step 3 — Operator validates  
Step 4 — Stress Tester identifies logical gaps  
Step 5 — Operator validates  
```

### **Outputs**
- tightened logic  
- clearer relationships  
- improved interpretability  

### **Drift Risks**
- Editor expanding meaning  
- Stress Tester proposing solutions  

---

# Section 4 — Diagnostic Workflow Sequence

Used when the operator needs:
- drift detection  
- structural integrity testing  
- contradiction identification  
- vulnerability mapping  

### **Sequence**
```
Step 1 — Operator provides the work to be tested  
Step 2 — Stress Tester attacks logic, structure, clarity, constraints  
Step 3 — Operator evaluates threats  
Step 4 — Architect (optional) performs structural corrections  
Step 5 — Editor (optional) cleans clarified corrections  
```

### **Outputs**
- vulnerability list  
- drift vectors  
- structural fault map  
- contradictions and pressure points  

### **Drift Risks**
- Stress Tester offering fixes  
- Architect overcorrecting  
- Operator approving untested corrections  

---

# Section 5 — Polish Workflow Sequence

Used when the content is structurally and logically complete.

### **Sequence**
```
Step 1 — Operator provides final draft  
Step 2 — Polisher cleans prose  
Step 3 — Operator evaluates tone and readability  
```

### **Outputs**
- final language pass  
- smoothed transitions  
- cleaned grammar  

### **Drift Risks**
- Polisher altering meaning  
- hidden structure changes  

---

# Section 6 — Full Lockstep Workflow (All Passes)

This is the **canonical IRONBOUND-AI master workflow**  
for long-form writing, frameworks, systems, and multi-model tasks.

### **Sequence**
```
1. Operator defines the command block  
2. Architect creates structure  
3. Operator validates  
4. Editor refines clarity  
5. Operator validates  
6. Stress Tester attacks  
7. Operator validates  
8. Polisher cleans final prose  
9. Operator approves final output
```

### **Outputs**
- complete, stable, drift-resistant work  
- structure intact  
- clarity maximized  
- vulnerabilities addressed  
- tone polished  

### **Drift Risks**
- any role mixing responsibilities  
- operator skipping validation  
- premature polishing  
- meaning alteration during clarity pass  

---

# Section 7 — Emergency Drift-Interruption Workflow

Used when drift appears mid-workflow.

### **Sequence**
```
1. Operator halts workflow immediately  
2. Operator restates intent + constraints  
3. Operator reassigns correct role  
4. Role re-executes pass cleanly  
5. Operator validates no drift remains  
```

### **Output**
- stabilized workflow  
- drift neutralized  
- role purity restored  

### **Drift Risks**
- continuing without halting  
- patching drift instead of rerunning  
- letting roles overlap

# Section 8 — When to Use Each Sequence

| Scenario | Sequence |
|---------|----------|
| Building a new system | Structural Workflow |
| Improving an existing document | Refinement Workflow |
| Testing for hidden problems | Diagnostic Workflow |
| Cleaning language for delivery | Polish Workflow |
| Multi-role, multi-pass complex task | Full Lockstep Workflow |
| Drift detected | Emergency Interruption Workflow |

---

# Section 9 — Why Workflow Sequences Matter

These sequences convert generative AI into a **predictable, modular, operator-controlled machine**.

They ensure:
- no model improvises  
- no role overlaps  
- no uncontrolled creativity  
- no collapsing structure  
- total operator control  

Without sequencing → AI drifts.  
With sequencing → AI computes.
