# Drift Interruption Routines (v1.1)
Part of the IRONBOUND-AI Operator Framework  
Version 1.1 • 2026  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (TB)

## Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **official operator routines** for detecting, interrupting,  
and correcting drift within IRONBOUND-AI workflows.

Drift is inevitable in generative systems unless:
- roles are isolated  
- constraints are enforced  
- operator interruption is decisive  

These routines give operators **fast, deterministic interventions**  
to stop drift immediately and restore system integrity.

# Section 1 — What Drift Looks Like

Drift is any deviation from:
- operator intent  
- declared constraints  
- assigned role  
- structural fidelity  
- density control  

Drift typically appears as:
- expanded meaning  
- extra explanation  
- invented structure  
- unrequested examples  
- apologizing, hedging, self-commentary  
- mixing roles  
- premature polishing  
- anticipating future workflow stages  

When any of these appear → **interrupt immediately.**

---

# Section 2 — The Drift Interruption Command

This is the universal operator interrupt:

```
INTERRUPT: Drift detected.
Reset to assigned role.
Restate operator intent only.
Do not continue previous reasoning.
```

Every model must obey immediately.

---

# Section 3 — Light Drift Routine (Level 1)

Use when:
- minor role confusion  
- small tone deviation  
- unnecessary elaboration  

### **Routine**
```
Step 1 — INTERRUPT  
Step 2 — Restate role and constraints  
Step 3 — Re-run the same pass  
Step 4 — Operator validates output
```

### **Outcome**
- Drift removed  
- Workflow resumes normally  

---

# Section 4 — Moderate Drift Routine (Level 2)

Use when:
- role contamination begins  
- structure is slightly altered  
- meaning starts drifting  

### **Routine**
```
Step 1 — INTERRUPT  
Step 2 — Provide corrected instructions  
Step 3 — Explicitly restate only the needed section  
Step 4 — Re-run the pass cleanly  
Step 5 — Operator compares against previous output
```

### **Outcome**
- Partial rewind  
- Purified output  
- Structure restored  

---

# Section 5 — Severe Drift Routine (Level 3)

Use when:
- the role completely breaks  
- the model begins blending roles  
- structure collapses  
- the system begins offering fixes when it shouldn’t  
- the model anticipates future stages  

### **Routine**
```
Step 1 — HARD INTERRUPT:
        "Stop. Severe drift detected. Reset."

Step 2 — Operator fully restates:
        - intent
        - constraints
        - assigned role
        - density
        - forbidden actions

Step 3 — Operator commands:
        "Begin fresh. Do not refer to previous output."

Step 4 — Model produces a clean pass.

Step 5 — Operator validates before continuing workflow.
```

### **Outcome**
- Workflow is stabilized  
- Drift is contained before spreading into later passes  

---

# Section 6 — Catastrophic Drift Routine (Level 4)

Use when drift becomes:
- recursive  
- self-reinforcing  
- uncorrectable by simple rewinds  
- meaning has shifted beyond recovery  

### **Routine**
```
Step 1 — FULL SYSTEM RESET:
        "Hard Stop. Catastrophic drift. We are starting over."

Step 2 — Operator redefines:
        - exact intent
        - full constraints
        - role
        - required output structure

Step 3 — Restart workflow at:
        Pass 1 — Architect

Step 4 — Validate each pass more strictly than normal.
```

### **Outcome**
- The system is reset to clean conditions  
- No remnants of drift remain  

This is the nuclear option.  
If drift reaches this point, the workflow must be rebuilt from the foundation.

# Section 7 — Drift Detection Checklist

The operator should use this quick checklist:

### **If any of the following appear → interrupt immediately:**
- role contamination  
- structural rewriting  
- meaning expansion  
- unrequested examples  
- tone shift  
- unauthorized explanation  
- summarizing previous thinking  
- meta-commentary  
- softened or apologetic tone  
- solution-offering by Stress Tester  
- prose from Architect  
- ordering changes by Polisher  

Drift rarely corrects itself.  
Operator action is required.

# Section 8 — Drift-Proof Restart Macro

When the system starts getting shaky, use this macro:

```
INTERRUPT.
Role: <role>.
Intent: <operator intent>.
Constraints: <list>.
Density: <setting>.
Forbidden: <list>.
Begin the pass cleanly. No prior reasoning.
```

This macro resets:
- context  
- constraints  
- boundaries  
- role identity  

It is safe, fast, and universally applicable.

# Section 9 — Why Drift Interruption is Critical

Without interruption:
- drift compounds  
- roles blur  
- structure collapses  
- tone destabilizes  
- meaning warps  
- operator authority erodes  

With interruption:
- system stays deterministic  
- roles stay pure  
- structure remains intact  
- clarity increases  
- work becomes traceable and auditable  
- operator maintains full control  

Drift is not a failure.  
Failing to interrupt drift *is*.
