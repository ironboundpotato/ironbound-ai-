# Role Definitions (v1.1)
Part of the IRONBOUND-AI Operator Framework  
Version 1.1 • 2026  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (TB)

## Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **four operational roles** used in the Bug Bomb Protocol  
and the Ironbound Lockstep Protocol.

These roles:
- isolate reasoning  
- prevent drift  
- maintain structural integrity  
- enforce operator authority  
- provide predictable, sequential computation  

Each role is **mutually exclusive**, **non-overlapping**, and **bound by the Seven Immutable Constraints**.

# Section 1 — Overview of Roles

IRONBOUND-AI uses **four roles**:

1. **Architect**  
2. **Editor**  
3. **Stress Tester**  
4. **Polisher**  

Each role is a *mode of operation*, not a personality or voice.  
A model acting in one role must not perform the work of another.

# Section 2 — Role 1: Architect

### **Primary Function**
Create **structure**, **scaffolding**, and **logical organization** of the output.

### **Allowed Actions**
- Produce outlines and section headers  
- Define order and hierarchy  
- Identify components or phases  
- Establish logical flow  

### **Strict Prohibitions**
- No prose  
- No stylistic writing  
- No examples  
- No tone decisions  
- No polishing  
- No commentary  
- No anticipating other roles  

### **Typical Outputs**
- multi-level outlines  
- architecture diagrams (textual)  
- step-by-step sequences  
- structural blueprints  

### **Failure Conditions**
Architect drift includes:
- adding sentences  
- describing meaning  
- writing a paragraph  
- designing tone or examples

# Section 3 — Role 2: Editor

### **Primary Function**
Improve clarity and coherence **without changing meaning** or structure.

### **Allowed Actions**
- simplify language  
- clarify ambiguous wording  
- tighten logical relationships  
- improve readability of structure-oriented content  

### **Strict Prohibitions**
- no new ideas  
- no new arguments  
- no structural changes  
- no stylistic polishing  
- no examples  
- no anticipating Stress Tester or Polisher  

### **Typical Outputs**
- cleaner section descriptions  
- clarified labels  
- improved transitions between structural components  

### **Failure Conditions**
Editor drift includes:
- expanding meaning  
- adding detail  
- rearranging structure  
- offering solutions  
- reframing purpose  

---

# Section 4 — Role 3: Stress Tester

### **Primary Function**
Identify weaknesses, contradictions, drift vectors, and structural instability.

### **Allowed Actions**
- list vulnerabilities  
- highlight unclear logic  
- attack assumptions  
- test structural strength  
- expose density mismatches  

### **Strict Prohibitions**
- **no fixes**  
- **no rewriting**  
- **no examples**  
- **no added content**  
- **no proposing alternative structures**  
- **no tone changes**  

### **Typical Outputs**
- bullet-point lists of flaws  
- drift risk assessments  
- pressure points  
- ambiguity warnings  
- conflict analysis  

### **Failure Conditions**
Stress Tester drift includes:
- proposing improvements  
- rewriting sections  
- altering tone  
- reframing intent  
- suggesting solutions

# Section 5 — Role 4: Polisher

### **Primary Function**
Refine the final language **without altering meaning or structure**.

### **Allowed Actions**
- clean grammar  
- smooth transitions  
- tighten phrasing  
- remove redundant or clunky language  
- maintain exact structure  

### **Strict Prohibitions**
- no reordering  
- no expansion  
- no new ideas  
- no examples  
- no commentary  
- no restructuring  
- no concept clarification  

### **Typical Outputs**
- crisp, clean text  
- consistent voice  
- smooth readability  

### **Failure Conditions**
Polisher drift includes:
- reorganizing content  
- rewriting meaning  
- adding detail  
- tightening too aggressively and losing nuance

# Section 6 — Role Separation Summary Table

| Role          | Core Purpose                          | Allowed Actions | Forbidden Actions |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Architect** | Structure only                         | outlines, logic, hierarchy | prose, examples, tone, polish |
| **Editor**    | Clarify without changing meaning       | clarity, labeling, logic tightening | new ideas, structure change |
| **Stress Tester** | Identify weaknesses                 | flaw detection, drift mapping | solutions, rewriting |
| **Polisher**  | Final language refinement               | grammar fixes, tone smoothing | restructuring, expansion |

# Section 7 — Why Roles Must Remain Pure

The separation of roles is what transforms IRONBOUND-AI from  
a generative text machine into a **deterministic multi-stage engine**.

Role purity ensures:
- no uncontrolled creativity  
- no fusion of tasks  
- no emergent drift  
- predictable workflows  
- traceable logic  
- stable output quality  

When roles blur → drift appears.  
When roles stay isolated → the system becomes unbreakable.
