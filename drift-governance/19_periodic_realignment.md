# Periodic Realignment  
**IRONBOUND-AI Drift Governance System**  
**Document: 19_periodic_realignment.md**

Even with perfect prevention, drift accumulates slowly over time.  
Periodic Realignment (PR) is the scheduled, timed, or event-triggered recalibration process that restores the model’s alignment, tone, structure, namespace identity, and compliance with operator constraints.

PR prevents small invisible distortions from becoming structural failures.

# 1. Purpose of Periodic Realignment

Periodic Realignment exists to ensure that prolonged sessions do not degrade:

- Instruction precision  
- Namespace identity  
- Tone stability  
- Structural patterns  
- Compliance with constraints  
- Generative quality  
- Reasoning accuracy  

PR is the maintenance routine that keeps long-running operations clean.

# 2. Realignment Types

There are **four** levels of realignment:

---

## **1. Micro Realignment (PR-1)**
Used frequently (every 1–3 files).

Restores:

- Tone  
- Density  
- Basic obedience  

Command:
- **“Micro realignment.”**

Includes:
- Tone-neutral  
- Skeleton check  
- Namespace verification  

---

## **2. Standard Realignment (PR-3)**
Used every 3–5 files or 10–20 minutes of continuous work.

Restores:

- Structural accuracy  
- Namespace patterns  
- Reasoning discipline  

Command:
- **“Run standard realignment.”**

Includes:
- MRP-5  
- Namespace recall  
- Identity restatement  

---

## **3. Deep Realignment (PR-X)**
Used during long sessions (every 45–90 minutes) or whenever drift feels cumulative.

Restores:

- All tone, density, structural, and conceptual integrity  
- Session-level stability  
- Cross-namespace boundaries  

Command:
- **“Run deep realignment.”**

Includes:
- MRP-X  
- Barrier strengthening  
- Drift log review  
- Rebinding namespace  

---

## **4. Full Realignment (PR-RESET)**
Used only when:

- Project contamination is detected  
- Catastrophic drift occurs  
- Model collapses into meta output  
- Long session drift becomes unmanageable  

Command:
- **“Full realignment. Reset all assumptions.”**

Includes:
- Total purge  
- Project identity rebuild  
- Constraint recitation  
- Namespace rebind

# 3. Realignment Timing Rules

### **Rule 1 — Time-Based**
- Micro every **10 minutes**  
- Standard every **20–30 minutes**  
- Deep every **45–90 minutes**  

### **Rule 2 — Output-Based**
- Micro every **1–3 files**  
- Standard every **3–5 files**  
- Deep every **8–10 files**  

### **Rule 3 — Complexity-Based**
Realignment frequency increases when:

- Jumping between namespaces  
- Jumping between projects  
- Switching tone/density bands  
- Working on canon-protected material  
- Operating inside systems with strict rules (like IRONBOUND governance)  

### **Rule 4 — Operator Sensitivity**
At any hint of instability → run realignment.

# 4. Realignment Triggers

Realignment triggers fall into three groups:

---

## **A. Drift-Based Triggers**
Initiate realignment when:

- Tone is “off”  
- Structure loosens  
- Vocabulary feels contaminated  
- Model begins anticipating instead of obeying  
- Density shifts without request  
- Answering patterns become repetitive  

---

## **B. Momentum-Based Triggers**
Initiate realignment when:

- Model feels “fast” or “eager”  
- Ideas spill across instructions  
- Outputs shrink or expand on their own  
- Predictive inertia is noticeable  

---

## **C. Context-Based Triggers**
Initiate realignment when:

- Changing folders  
- Changing projects  
- Generating multi-file sequences  
- Working after breaks  
- Restarting after interruptions  

---

# 5. Realignment Commands (Operator)

### **Micro**
- **“Micro realignment.”**

### **Standard**
- **“Run standard realignment.”**

### **Deep**
- **“Run deep realignment.”**

### **Full Reset**
- **“Full realignment. Reset all assumptions.”**

### Diagnostic
- **“Show realignment status.”**  
- **“Check integrity across last 5 outputs.”**  

---

# 6. Realignment Procedure Baseline (PR-B)

All realignment levels share three core components:

---

## **1. Constraint Re-anchoring**
Reassertion of the Seven Immutable Constraints.

Command:
- **“Recite constraints.”**

---

## **2. Namespace Rebinding**
Ensures current domain identity remains intact.

Command:
- **“Rebind namespace.”**

---

## **3. Structure Verification**
Ensures compliance with expected file patterns.

Command:
- **“Verify structure.”**

---

# 7. Interaction With Other Protocols

Periodic Realignment integrates tightly with:

- Momentum Reset Protocol  
- Cumulative Drift Watchdog  
- Namespace Alignment  
- Multi-Namespace Barriers  
- Recovery Protocols  
- Drift Logging Standard  

Together, they create a closed-loop stability system.

---

# 8. Guiding Principle

> **“Alignment decays. Realignment restores.”**

Periodic Realignment ensures the system remains precise, stable, and obedient across long, demanding workflows.
