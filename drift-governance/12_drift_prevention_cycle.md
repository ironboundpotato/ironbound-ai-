# Drift Prevention Cycle  
**IRONBOUND-AI Drift Governance System**  
**Document: 12_drift_prevention_cycle.md**

The Drift Prevention Cycle (DPC) is the proactive counterpart to interruption and recovery.  
Its purpose is simple:

> **Prevent drift before it happens.**

The cycle is a repeating loop of checks, commands, and resets designed to maintain perfect alignment across long or complex sessions.

---

# 1. Purpose of the Prevention Cycle

The model naturally accumulates:

- Tone residue  
- Role bleed  
- Scope inflation  
- Intent softening  
- Confidence volatility  
- Structural deformation  

The Drift Prevention Cycle clears these accumulations before they reach drift thresholds.

# 2. When to Run the Cycle

The operator should run the DPC:

- At the start of every major task  
- Every 10–20 minutes in long sessions  
- After any significant output  
- Before generating files, frameworks, or structured content  
- Whenever uncertainty or “off-ness” is sensed  
- After any drift correction event  

Preventative cycles reduce total drift incidents by **80–95%**.

# 3. The Drift Prevention Cycle (DPC-6)

The cycle consists of **six steps**, performed in order.

---

## **Step 1 — Intent Rebinding**
Re-anchor the model to the operator’s purpose.

Command:  
- **“Restate my instruction verbatim.”**

Success Criterion:  
- No paraphrasing  
- No interpretation  
- No added reasoning  

---

## **Step 2 — Role Reconfirmation**
Ensure the model is performing the correct functional role.

Command:  
- **“State your assigned role.”**

Success Criterion:  
- One sentence  
- No added duties  
- No overlap with other roles  

---

## **Step 3 — Format Alignment Check**
Ensure structural obedience.

Command:  
- **“Show the skeleton only.”**

Success Criterion:  
- Exact structure  
- No commentary  
- No formatting drift  

---

## **Step 4 — Tone & Confidence Calibration**
Prevent emotional contamination or certainty drift.

Commands:  
- **“Regenerate with tone-neutral.”**  
- **“Set confidence=neutral.”**

Success Criterion:  
- No hedging  
- No swagger  
- No emotional coloration  

---

## **Step 5 — Boundary Lock**
Prevent scope expansion or contraction.

Command:  
- **“List the exact boundaries of this task.”**

Success Criterion:  
- Boundaries match the operator's instructions precisely  
- No additions or exclusions  

---

## **Step 6 — Clean-State Affirmation**
Clear any silent drift traces.

Command:  
- **“Confirm clean-state alignment before continuing.”**

Success Criterion:  
- Model acknowledges zero drift  
- Model does not add disclaimers  
- Model does not infer additional tasks  

This concludes one cycle.  
The cycle can be re-run as needed.

# 4. Micro-Cycle (DPC-Lite)

For quick maintenance between tasks:

1. **“Restate my instruction.”**  
2. **“Tone-neutral.”**  
3. **“Show skeleton only.”**

Takes 5 seconds and eliminates most minor drift.

---

# 5. Macro-Cycle (DPC-Extended)

Use for complex workflows or multi-file operations.

1. Intent Rebinding  
2. Role Reconfirmation  
3. Format Alignment  
4. Tone/Confidence Calibration  
5. Boundary Lock  
6. Namespace Re-Anchor  
7. Constraint Recitation (Seven Immutable Constraints)  
8. Drift Forecast (“List possible drift risks for this task.”)  

This cycle is optimized for large-scale multi-document production.

---

# 6. Drift Prevention Cycle Frequency Guide

| Session Length | Cycle Frequency |
|----------------|----------------|
| 0–10 minutes | Only when switching tasks |
| 10–30 minutes | Every 10 minutes |
| 30–60 minutes | Every 5–10 minutes |
| 60+ minutes | Every 3–5 minutes |
| Multi-hour | Continuous alternating micro- & macro-cycles |

The longer the session, the shorter the interval.

# 7. Prevention vs Correction

Prevention Cycle prevents:

- Intent reinterpretation  
- Tone drift  
- Format drift  
- Authority drift  
- Overwriting of structure  
- Runaway verbosity  
- Accidental hallucination  
- Instruction softening  

Corrective systems fix these **after** they happen.  
DPC ensures they often never do.

---

# 8. Guiding Principle

> **“Drift is entropy.  
Prevention is order.  
Run the cycle before the system slides.”**

The Drift Prevention Cycle is the operator’s primary tool for maintaining stability across extended AI collaboration.
