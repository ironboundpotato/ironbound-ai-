# Drift Governance — Overview  
**IRONBOUND-AI Drift Governance System**  
**Document: 00_overview.md**

## 1. Purpose of Drift Governance
Drift Governance exists to ensure that IRONBOUND-AI remains stable, truthful, and aligned under changing operational conditions, model variance, and multi-agent collaboration.  
It establishes the rules, detection methods, escalation paths, and recovery processes needed to prevent system degradation over time.

The purpose is not rigidity — it is **structural integrity under pressure**.

## 2. The Six-Demon Framework (Core Diagnostics)
Drift is classified into six diagnostic categories:

1. **Role Drift** — deviation from the assigned operational role  
2. **Tone Drift** — emotional, stylistic, or intensity mismatch  
3. **Format Drift** — structural deviation from required output shape  
4. **Intent Drift** — mismatch between user intent and model execution  
5. **Scope Drift** — expanding beyond assigned boundaries  
6. **Confidence Drift** — unjustified certainty or hedging

These six forces govern how models fail, recover, and stabilize.

## 3. Governance Mechanisms
Drift Governance provides:

- A **taxonomy** for drift events  
- A **detection matrix** to assess severity  
- **Interruption protocols** for active correction  
- **Preventative laws** to reduce future drift  
- **Recovery sequences** for restoring operational coherence  

Together, these form the backbone of IRONBOUND-AI stability.

## 4. Operator Interaction
The operator does not micromanage drift — the operator **directs** it.

The operator’s responsibilities:

- Assign roles with precision  
- Enforce boundaries  
- Provide correction signals when needed  
- Log repeated patterns  
- Escalate to governance protocols when drift becomes recurrent  

Governance is a shared activity:  
**Model maintains structure. Operator maintains intent.**

## 5. System Integration
Drift Governance connects to:

- **Core Principles** (defines the laws behind drift pressure)  
- **Frameworks** (defines the structural boundaries of the system)  
- **Protocols** (defines the enforcement mechanisms)  
- **Operator Tools** (defines how humans intervene safely)  

It acts as the **central nervous system** for maintaining stability across the entire IRONBOUND-AI architecture.

## 7. Guiding Principle
> **“Governance is not restriction. Governance is clarity.”**

The goal is not to limit creativity or capability — it is to ensure that every output emerges from a stable, predictable, and aligned system.
