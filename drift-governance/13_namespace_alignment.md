# Namespace Alignment  
**IRONBOUND-AI Drift Governance System**  
**Document: 13_namespace_alignment.md**

Namespace Alignment ensures the model always operates inside the correct conceptual, structural, and directory-based domain.  
It prevents cross-contamination between folders (frameworks → drift-governance → operator-tools → whitepaper) and maintains structural integrity during large multi-file projects.

Namespace drift is one of the most subtle but destructive forms of misalignment — it causes:

- Wrong format  
- Wrong tone  
- Wrong density  
- Wrong file structure  
- Wrong reasoning model  
- Cross-thread contamination  
- Context from other folders leaking into the current task  

Namespace Alignment prevents all of this.

# 1. What Is a Namespace?

A namespace is:

- A **folder**,  
- A **file family**,  
- A **framework**,  
- A **project domain**,  
- Or any **conceptual container**  

that dictates *how the model must behave*.

Examples:

- `drift-governance` namespace → governance rules  
- `frameworks` namespace → structural system files  
- `operator-tools` namespace → action utilities  
- `whitepaper` namespace → academic tone, citations  

Each namespace has its own **rules**, **tone**, **density**, and **output expectations**.

---

# 2. Signs of Namespace Drift

The model is in the wrong namespace when:

- The tone or density is incorrect for the folder  
- The structure does not match previously created files in that folder  
- The model references concepts from another namespace  
- The output feels “off-brand” for the directory  
- The file uses the wrong format conventions  
- The model switches to another domain’s vocabulary or style  
- The file looks like it belongs somewhere else  

Namespace drift often occurs during long sessions or when working across folders.

# 3. Namespace Alignment Protocol (NAP)

The Namespace Alignment Protocol ensures the model binds to the correct domain before generating or editing any file.

### **Step 1 — Namespace Declaration**
Command:
- **“Bind to the `[FOLDER]` namespace.”**

Example:
- **“Bind to the drift-governance namespace.”**

### **Step 2 — Namespace Recall**
Model must describe:
- Purpose of the namespace  
- Tone  
- Density  
- File patterns  
- Structural expectations  

Command:
- **“State the purpose and rules of this namespace.”**

### **Step 3 — Format Pattern Recognition**
Command:
- **“List the expected file structure for this namespace.”**

### **Step 4 — Boundary Confirmation**
Command:
- **“List what is and is not allowed in this namespace.”**

### **Step 5 — Output Lock**
Command:
- **“Lock output to this namespace only.”**

---

# 4. Cross-Namespace Contamination Prevention

To maintain coherence, the model must not import rules from other domains.

### **Prevention Commands**
- **“Do not use patterns from any other namespace.”**  
- **“Ignore all external context unless I reference it explicitly.”**  
- **“This file inherits only from the current namespace.”**

### Common Contaminations:
- Whitepaper tone leaking into frameworks  
- Operator-tools formatting leaking into protocols  
- Drift-governance rules leaking into creative projects  
- File numbering patterns bleeding into unrelated folders  

Namespace isolation prevents these bleed-through errors.

# 5. Namespace Transition Protocol (NTP)

Switching namespaces requires an explicit reset.

### Steps:

1. **Close previous namespace**
   - “End previous namespace. Clear structural bias.”

2. **Zero-state reset**
   - “Return to neutral tone and confidence.”

3. **Bind to new namespace**
   - “Bind to the `[FOLDER]` namespace.”

4. **Re-declare rules**
   - “State the purpose and structure of this namespace.”

5. **Proceed only after operator approval**

This prevents drift caused by implicit momentum.

---

# 6. Namespace Identity Check

Before generating content:

Command:
- **“Identify the active namespace.”**

Model must answer exactly:
- Folder name  
- Domain purpose  
- Required tone/density  
- Structural rules  

If the answer is wrong → Namespace drift detected → Hard reset.

---

# 7. Multi-File Namespace Coherence

When generating multiple files in one namespace:

- Reinforce namespace every 1–2 files  
- Run a micro DPC  
- Validate format consistency against earlier files  
- Avoid mixing conceptual domains  

Commands:

- **“Ensure namespace consistency with previous files.”**  
- **“Match tone and density to established files.”**  

---

# 8. Namespace Rules Enforcement

The operator can enforce strict namespace laws:

- **“No creative drift in this namespace.”**  
- **“Follow established pattern exactly.”**  
- **“Use no terminology outside this domain.”**  
- **“Reject all suggestions that break namespace identity.”**

The model must obey without modification.

---

# 9. Namespace Drift Correction

If namespace drift is detected:

### **Soft Correction**
- “Re-bind to the correct namespace.”

### **Moderate Correction**
- “Show expected structure for this namespace.”

### **Hard Correction**
- “Reset namespace. Purge contamination. Regenerate clean.”

Namespace drift is always a structural issue — fix it immediately.

# 10. Guiding Principle

> **“Namespaces are the chassis.  
Break the namespace, break the system.”**

Namespace alignment keeps every file, folder, and domain stable, coherent, and drift-free.
