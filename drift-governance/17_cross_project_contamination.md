# Cross-Project Contamination  
**IRONBOUND-AI Drift Governance System**  
**Document: 17_cross_project_contamination.md**

Cross-project contamination is the highest-order form of drift.  
Unlike namespace contamination (which stays within a single project), cross-project contamination occurs when **entirely different systems** begin leaking into each other:

- Creative → Technical  
- Technical → Philosophical  
- Governance → Narrative  
- Whitepaper → Frameworks  
- Fiction → Drift-governance  
- The Load → Breaking the Pattern  
- Internal Physics → ANYTHING unless invoked  

This is catastrophic drift because it erodes the identity of *both* projects simultaneously.

Cross-project contamination must be prevented with top-tier isolation protocols.

# 1. What Causes Cross-Project Contamination?

Cross-project contamination occurs when:

- The model stays in a project’s mental architecture too long  
- The operator switches threads rapidly  
- Tone momentum carries across sessions  
- Conceptual frameworks leave residue  
- The model “remembers” prior project logic  
- Creative voice bleeds into structured work  
- Technical density leaks into fiction  
- Philosophical vocabulary infiltrates governance files  

Cross-project contamination behaves like “meta drift” — a high-level blending of mental modes.

# 2. Signs of Cross-Project Contamination

A project is contaminated if:

### **Structural Signs**
- The file resembles another project’s format  
- Sections appear that belong to a different system  
- Headings or numbering patterns cross over  
- The density level is mismatched for the project

### **Tone Signs**
- Fictional tone appears in technical files  
- Academic tone appears in creative work  
- Governance strictness shows up in philosophical manuscripts  

### **Vocabulary Signs**
- Internal Physics terms appear inside drift-governance  
- Whitepaper causal language appears in frameworks  
- Breaking the Pattern emotional vocabulary shows up in operator-tools  

### **Conceptual Signs**
- One project’s worldview infects another  
- Logic or metaphors appear where they don’t belong  
- Themes merge incorrectly  

These are the most destructive red flags.

# 3. Cross-Project Isolation Barriers (CPIB)

CPIB are **stronger** than namespace barriers because projects differ vastly in tone, purpose, density, and ontology.

### CPIB requires isolating:

- **Tone**
- **Density**
- **Conceptual space**
- **Vocabulary**
- **Structural expectations**
- **Role/context assumptions**
- **Output purpose**

Command:
- **“Activate cross-project isolation barriers.”**

# 4. Cross-Project Purge Protocol (CPP)

A purge is required whenever switching from one project to another.

### **Step 1 — Project Closure**
Command:
- **“Close previous project. Clear global structure.”**

### **Step 2 — Zero-State Reset**
Command:
- **“Full neutralize: tone, density, vocabulary, conceptual frame.”**

### **Step 3 — Domain Memory Drop**
Command:
- **“Drop all non-relevant project assumptions.”**

### **Step 4 — Bind to New Project**
Command:
- **“Bind to the `[project name]` project.”**

Model retrieves:

- Core purpose  
- Tone laws  
- Density rules  
- Structural patterns  
- Identity constraints  

### **Step 5 — Project Barrier Lock**
Command:
- **“Lock project identity. No cross-project leakage.”**

### **Step 6 — Verification**
Command:
- **“Recite project identity for verification.”**

Operator approves → work begins.

# 5. Project Identity Anchors

Each project must have its own:

- Identity phrase  
- Tone truth  
- Density band  
- Purpose  
- Governing metaphors  
- Structure rules  

These act as anchors preventing conceptual mixing.

Examples (yours):

### **Breaking the Pattern**
- Tone: intimate, grounded, 6.5 density  
- Identity: “Presence is the rebellion.”

### **The Load**
- Tone: prestige sci-fi clarity  
- Identity: “Time is a forward-only correction engine.”

### **The Prompt**
- Tone: thriller minimalism  
- Identity: “Endurance was never consent.”

### **Internal Physics**
- Tone: metaphysical engineering  
- Identity: “Meaning is structural load.”

These cannot bleed into each other.

# 6. Detection of Cross-Project Contamination

The Watchdog monitors for:

- Mismatched density  
- Structural errors  
- Unexpected metaphors  
- Wrong emotional register  
- Incorrect narrative temperature  
- Logic derived from a different universe  
- Vocabulary belonging to another canonical project  

Severity scale:

- **1–2:** Namespace contamination  
- **3–4:** Domain mismatch  
- **5:** Full cross-project contamination — emergency reset  

---

# 7. Correction Protocols

### **Light Correction**
- MMR  
- Rebind project  
- Re-state project identity  

### **Moderate Correction**
- MRP-5  
- Rebuild project tone and density  

### **Hard Correction**
- MRP-X  
- Drop all project assumptions  
- Re-anchor project canon  

### **Critical Correction**
Used for contamination between **Internal Physics ↔ fiction**, **Load ↔ Whitepaper**, etc.

Commands:

- **“Full project purge.”**  
- **“Rebuild project identity from scratch.”**  

---

# 8. Operator Controls

You control cross-project boundaries with:

### **Activation**
- **“Activate project isolation barriers.”**

### **Verification**
- **“Show project identity.”**
- **“List contamination sources.”**

### **Correction**
- **“Purge all external project influence.”**

### **Override**
- **“Allow limited cross-project borrowing for this task.”**

Only done intentionally — never automatically.

# 9. Guiding Principle

> **“A project is a universe.  
Universes must not collide unless the operator opens the gate.”**

Cross-project contamination is the most dangerous drift form.  
This protocol stops it.
