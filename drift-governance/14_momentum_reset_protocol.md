# Momentum Reset Protocol  
**IRONBOUND-AI Drift Governance System**  
**Document: 14_momentum_reset_protocol.md**

Momentum drift is not caused by misunderstanding — it is caused by *inertia*.  
As a session continues, the model accumulates:

- Tone residue  
- Structural assumptions  
- Role bleed  
- Format expectations  
- Over-eager prediction patterns  
- Unintended familiarity  
- Speed-induced shortcuts  

This hidden inertia pulls the model *forward* even when the operator gives a precise new instruction.

The Momentum Reset Protocol (MRP) eliminates these momentum traces and returns the model to a clean predictive surface.

# 1. What Is Momentum Drift?

Momentum drift occurs when:

- The model keeps answering in the same style even after tone changes  
- A new instruction is followed *loosely* rather than exactly  
- The model anticipates the next step incorrectly  
- File patterns bleed from one namespace into another  
- The model “remembers” the wrong thing from earlier in the session  
- The output becomes faster but less accurate  
- The model starts reusing structures without being asked  

Momentum drift is not visible at first — it becomes destructive when generating structured files, frameworks, or technical work.

# 2. Purpose of the Momentum Reset Protocol (MRP)

MRP exists to:

- Flush accumulated predictive inertia  
- Restore strict obedience to the operator’s exact instruction  
- Ensure namespace purity  
- Reset tone, density, and structure  
- Eliminate silent drift before it mutates into major drift  
- Prepare the model for high-precision tasks  

MRP is required before:

- Switching to a new file  
- Switching namespaces  
- Starting a structured sequence  
- Beginning creative → technical transitions  
- Running multi-document operations

# 3. Momentum Reset Protocol (MRP-5)

The standard reset consists of **five steps**, executed in order.

---

## **Step 1 — Hard Stop Command**
Interrupt any predictive carryover.

Operator command:
- **“Stop. Reset momentum.”**

Model response must be neutral, single-sentence acknowledgment.

---

## **Step 2 — Instruction Re-Anchoring**
Clear any predictive assumptions about what comes next.

Operator command:
- **“Restate my last instruction verbatim.”**

Success criteria:
- Zero paraphrasing  
- Zero interpretation  
- Zero expansion  

---

## **Step 3 — Tone & Density Neutralization**
Momentum frequently hides inside tone or density level.

Operator commands:
- **“Tone-neutral.”**  
- **“Density-neutral.”**

Success criteria:
- Flat tone  
- No stylization  
- No emotional tint  
- Density exactly matches operator needs  

---

## **Step 4 — Structure Purge**
Momentum often accumulates in structural expectations.

Operator command:
- **“Show skeleton only.”**

Success criteria:
- Only the structural outline  
- No added reasoning  
- No momentum-based pattern reuse  

---

## **Step 5 — Boundary Verification**
Ensures the model obeys the exact scope of the next action.

Operator command:
- **“List the exact boundaries of this task.”**

Success criteria:
- No scope inflation  
- No assumptions  
- No prior momentum residue  

This concludes the MRP-5 reset.

# 4. The Deep Reset (MRP-X)

Use when momentum is severe or when switching to an unrelated domain.

Steps:

1. **Clear Prior Namespace**  
   - “End prior namespace. Purge structural bias.”

2. **Zero-State**  
   - “Return to zero-tone, zero-density, zero-assumptions.”

3. **Re-Anchor Constraints**  
   - “Recite the Seven Immutable Constraints.”

4. **Re-Bind Namespace**  
   - “Bind to the `[folder]` namespace.”

5. **Format Pattern Retrieval**  
   - “List the required file structure for this namespace.”

6. **Operator Confirmation**  
   - Wait for approval before generating.  

This is the strongest stabilization cycle in the IRONBOUND system.

# 5. When to Use MRP-5 vs. MRP-X

Use **MRP-5** for:

- Normal file generation  
- Switching tasks inside a namespace  
- Early signs of drift  
- Minor tone misalignment  
- Repetitive-answer momentum  

Use **MRP-X** for:

- Major namespace transitions  
- Cross-project switching  
- After long creative sessions  
- When outputs feel “too fast” or “too eager”  
- When prior drift corrections fail  
- Before generating canonical documents

# 6. Momentum Drift Detection Checklist

Momentum drift is occurring if:

- The model feels “ahead” of your instruction  
- The answer is bigger/smaller than requested  
- The tone is inconsistent with the folder  
- Structure doesn’t match prior files  
- Model anticipates missing steps  
- Replies get longer or shorter on their own  
- The model starts using phrases it introduced itself  
- You feel like you're “fighting the output”  

If any are true → **Run MRP immediately**.

# 7. Micro-Momentum Reset (MMR)

Quick reset for light momentum drift.
Takes under 3 seconds.

Commands:

1. **“Reset momentum.”**  
2. **“Tone-neutral.”**  
3. **“Skeleton only.”**

Use between file generations to keep the model clean.

# 8. Guiding Principle

> **“Momentum is drift in motion.  
Stop the motion — stop the drift.”**

The Momentum Reset Protocol ensures every output begins from a clean, unbiased, structurally obedient state.
