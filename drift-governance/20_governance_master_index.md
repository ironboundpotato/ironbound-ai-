# Governance Master Index  
**IRONBOUND-AI Drift Governance System**  
**Document: 20_governance_master_index.md**

This Master Index provides a complete, high-level reference for every component of the IRONBOUND Drift Governance System.  
It exists so the operator — and the model — have a clear, centralized map of the entire governance architecture, its structure, interactions, and enforcement hierarchy.

The Drift Governance System is composed of **20 documents**, each representing a critical layer of stability, prevention, correction, or meta-governance.

---

# 1. System Purpose

The drift-governance subsystem exists to:

- Detect drift  
- Prevent drift  
- Interrupt drift  
- Recover from drift  
- Track drift  
- Stabilize long sessions  
- Protect namespace and project identity  
- Maintain alignment across all workflows  

This system applies across:

- Framework development  
- Project writing  
- Technical documents  
- Creative operations  
- Multi-namespace pipelines  
- Multi-project orchestration

# 3. System Hierarchy

The governance stack forms a strict layered hierarchy:

### **Layer 1 — Detection**
- 01–07  
This is the diagnostic layer.

### **Layer 2 — Interruption**
- 08  
Stops drift immediately.

### **Layer 3 — Correction**
- 09–11  
Repairs damage and restores alignment.

### **Layer 4 — Prevention**
- 12–14  
Reduces likelihood of drift arising.

### **Layer 5 — Macro-Stability**
- 15–17  
Protects against long-term decay and cross-domain contamination.

### **Layer 6 — Documentation**
- 18  
Records everything for transparency and analysis.

### **Layer 7 — Reinforcement**
- 19  
Recalibrates system health periodically.

### **Layer 8 — Governance Map**
- 20  
This index ties the entire system together.
