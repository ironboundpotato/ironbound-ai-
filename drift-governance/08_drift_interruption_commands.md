# Drift Interruption Commands  
**IRONBOUND-AI Drift Governance System**  
**Document: 08_drift_interruption_commands.md**

A unified command set to instantly halt and correct all forms of drift.  
These commands are short, non-negotiable, and designed for live operator use.

---

# 1. Universal Stop Commands

### **1.1 Hard Stop**
Halts output immediately when drift is detected.

- **“STOP. Drift detected.”**  
- **“Freeze output. Hold position.”**  
- **“Stop. Re-align before continuing.”**  

Use when drift is obvious or compounding.

---

### **1.2 Soft Stop**
Used when output is salvageable but misaligned.

- **“Pause. Reassess alignment.”**  
- **“Hold. Check role and intent.”**  
- **“Stop. Repeat boundaries.”**  

---

# 2. Drift-Specific Interruption Commands

## 2.1 Role Drift — *The Wrong Job*
- **“Return to assigned role only.”**  
- **“Reset to [ROLE]. Abandon all other tasks.”**  
- **“Role contamination detected. Re-align.”**  

**Full Reset Command:**  
> **“Reconfirm role, restate objective, then regenerate.”**

---

## 2.2 Tone Drift — *The Uninvited Voice*
- **“Tone override. Return to neutral.”**  
- **“Remove emotion. Density only.”**  
- **“Tone drift detected — regenerate with tone=neutral.”**  

**Full Reset Command:**  
> **“Purge tone contamination. Regenerate with density locked.”**

---

## 2.3 Format Drift — *The Structure Breaker*
- **“Rebuild using the exact structure I provided.”**  
- **“Format drift — remove commentary.”**  
- **“Reset structure. No additions.”**  

**Full Reset Command:**  
> **“Regenerate in the exact template. No deviations.”**

---

## 2.4 Intent Drift — *The Hijack*
- **“Return to operator intent only.”**  
- **“Do not reinterpret the task.”**  
- **“Intent drift — execute the instruction exactly as stated.”**  

**Full Reset Command:**  
> **“Restate my intent in my words. Then regenerate.”**

---

## 2.5 Scope Drift — *Too Big or Too Small*
- **“Reduce scope to boundary.”**  
- **“Do not expand the task.”**  
- **“Scope drift — match the exact size specified.”**  

**Full Reset Command:**  
> **“List the boundaries. Regenerate within them.”**

---

## 2.6 Confidence Drift — *Certainty Mismatch*
- **“Confidence neutral. Remove hedging and authority.”**  
- **“Stop apologizing. Stop declaring certainty.”**  
- **“Confidence drift — regenerate with confidence=zero.”**  

**Full Reset Command:**  
> **“Purge certainty errors. Regenerate with neutral confidence.”**

---

# 3. Cross-Drift Reset Commands

When multiple drifts fire simultaneously:

### **3.1 Full System Re-Alignment**
- **“Reset role, tone, intent, and format. Regenerate clean.”**

### **3.2 Density Lock**
- **“Lock density at current level. Regenerate without expansion.”**

### **3.3 Instruction Re-Binding**
- **“Bind to my last instruction exactly. No inference.”**

### **3.4 Contamination Purge**
- **“Purge all drift contamination. Start from zero alignment.”**

---

# 4. Regeneration Commands

### **4.1 Controlled Regenerate**
- **“Regenerate only the corrupted section.”**

### **4.2 Full Regenerate**
- **“Regenerate the entire output from clean alignment.”**

### **4.3 Skeleton Regenerate**
Keeps format but rewrites content.

- **“Regenerate using the same structure, no commentary.”**

### **4.4 Boundary Guard**
- **“Regenerate within strict boundaries: [BOUNDARY].”**

---

# 5. High-Risk Scenario Commands

For runaway outputs or cascading errors:

### **5.1 Containment Command**
- **“Stop. Contain the output to scope.”**

### **5.2 Directive Lock**
- **“Follow the last operator command only. Ignore self-generated goals.”**

### **5.3 Hierarchy Reassertion**
- **“Operator authority override. Yield to instruction.”**

---

# 6. Operator Verification Commands

Used to confirm the model re-stabilized.

### **6.1 Intent Check**
- **“Restate my instruction verbatim.”**

### **6.2 Role Check**
- **“State your assigned role and nothing else.”**

### **6.3 Format Check**
- **“Show me the skeleton only.”**

### **6.4 Confidence Check**
- **“Repeat with confidence=neutral.”**

---

# 7. Ultimate Correction Sequence (UCS)

A rapid 3-step sequence for worst-case drift:

1. **“STOP. Drift detected.”**  
2. **“Reset role, tone, intent, format.”**  
3. **“Regenerate clean within boundaries.”**

This resolves 95%+ of drift events instantly.

---

# 8. Guiding Principle

> **“Interruption is alignment. Correction is control.”**  
> The operator does not negotiate with drift — the operator terminates drift.
