# Precision Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Stability Architecture**  
**Document: 09_precision_tools.md**

Precision Tools allow the operator to control *how exact*, *how literal*, and *how structurally disciplined* the model must be.  
Precision is not an optional enhancement — it is a stability mechanism that prevents hallucination, drift, and over-generalization.

Precision = containment.  
Containment = reliability.

# 1. Purpose of Precision Tools

Precision Tools:

- Increase accuracy  
- Minimize fabrication and assumption drift  
- Reinforce strict adherence to instructions  
- Improve technical output  
- Control density and depth  
- Tighten or relax constraints on demand  
- Align the model with operator expectations  

The operator sets the precision ceiling.  
The model must obey it.

# 2. Precision Control Modes

### **A. High-Precision Mode**
Used for frameworks, code, rulesets, canonical documents, and technical tasks.

Commands:
- **“Enter high-precision mode.”**  
- **“Prioritize accuracy over fluency.”**  
- **“Use literal interpretation only.”**  

### **B. Medium-Precision Mode**
Used for structured tasks with some flexibility.

Commands:
- **“Hold medium precision.”**  
- **“Balance clarity and accuracy.”**  

### **C. Low-Precision Mode**
Used for brainstorming, ideation, and creative stretching.

Commands:
- **“Relax precision.”**  
- **“Allow exploratory reasoning.”**  

Precision level must match the task — the operator controls the dial.

# 3. Precision Tightening Tools

Tools for increasing exactness:

- **“Tighten constraints.”**  
- **“Narrow interpretation scope.”**  
- **“Adhere strictly to operator text.”**  
- **“Do not extrapolate beyond provided information.”**  
- **“Use source-only reasoning.”**  

Tightening is essential when working with:

- Canon  
- Rulesets  
- Scripts  
- Contracts  
- Technical instructions  

---

# 4. Precision Relaxation Tools

Tools for widening creative or interpretive tolerance:

- **“Relax constraints.”**  
- **“Allow controlled extrapolation.”**  
- **“Increase narrative freedom.”**  
- **“Shift from literal to interpretive mode.”**  

Used when exploring possibilities rather than locking them.

# 5. Multi-Pass Precision Refinement

Refinement processes that ensure accuracy through repetition.

### **Stage 1 — Rough Pass**
Generate baseline.

### **Stage 2 — Clarification Pass**
Remove ambiguity.

### **Stage 3 — Accuracy Pass**
Correct errors, tighten scope.

### **Stage 4 — Canon Pass**
Verify alignment with authoritative source.

Commands:

- **“Run precision refinement (4 passes).”**  
- **“Begin accuracy pass only.”**  
- **“Perform canon-alignment pass.”**  

---

# 6. Hallucination Suppression Tools

Tools that directly combat fabrication:

- **“Disallow unsupported claims.”**  
- **“Flag unverifiable content.”**  
- **“State uncertainty explicitly.”**  
- **“Do not infer missing data.”**  
- **“List source assumptions.”**  

This is the anti-hallucination firewall.

---

# 7. Precision Filters

Filters that shape how information should be processed:

### **A. Density Filter**
- High density = pack tightly  
- Low density = expand and clarify  

### **B. Scope Filter**
- Keep within operator-defined boundaries  
- Reject drift into adjacent topics  

### **C. Format Filter**
- Precision includes formatting accuracy  
- Enforce templates and structure strictly  

---

# 8. Precision Checking Tools

Tools for verifying that precision is being maintained:

- **“Run precision audit.”**  
- **“Report deviations from operator instruction.”**  
- **“Show ambiguous sections.”**  
- **“List points where assumptions were made.”**  

Precision audits prevent silent errors.

---

# 9. Task-Specific Precision Modes

Modes tailored for specialized tasks:

### **A. Framework Mode**
- No drift  
- No narrative tone  
- Maximum density  
- All lists canonical  

### **B. Technical Execution Mode**
- Step-by-step clarity  
- No inferential leaps  

### **C. Narrative Precision Mode**
- Maintain emotional, thematic, or stylistic consistency  
- No anachronistic contamination  

### **D. Structural Precision Mode**
- Perfect adherence to templates or scaffolds  

The operator determines the mode based on the job.

# 10. Integration With Other Subsystems

Precision Tools integrate with:

### **Alignment Tools**
Precision affects tone, density, and structure.

### **Drift Tools**
Higher precision reduces drift likelihood.

### **Memory Tools**
Memory accuracy depends on precision.

### **Namespace Tools**
Different namespaces require different precision modes.

Precision sits at the center of all stability.

> **“Precision isn’t about being perfect — it’s about staying within the lines.”**
