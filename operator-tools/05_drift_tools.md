# Drift Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Stability Architecture**  
**Document: 05_drift_tools.md**

Drift Tools are the operator’s **front-line instruments** for detecting, interrupting, and correcting drift in real time.  
They function as lightweight, operator-facing versions of the deeper drift-governance system, optimized for speed and immediacy during active workflows.

Where Alignment Tools maintain the baseline,  
**Drift Tools catch deviations the moment they appear.**

# 1. Purpose of Drift Tools

Drift Tools exist to:

- Detect drift early  
- Interrupt drift instantly  
- Stabilize the system before errors compound  
- Classify drift quickly using simplified heuristics  
- Provide operator-ready correction commands  
- Reinforce namespace & constraint integrity  
- Keep long workflows clean and predictable  

Drift Tools = early warning + immediate correction.

# 2. Drift Types (Operator View)

Drift-Governance contains full classifications, but the operator uses simplified drift cues:

### **1. Role Drift → “You’re not being the right version of yourself.”**  
Signs: unsolicited advising, meta behavior, tone shifts.

### **2. Tone Drift → “Energy or emotional posture is off.”**  
Signs: too flat, too intense, too casual, too sentimental.

### **3. Format Drift → “Structure breaks.”**  
Signs: missing workflow format, commentary inside code blocks, unordered sections.

### **4. Intent Drift → “You’re interpreting instead of obeying.”**  
Signs: answering early, guessing intent, adding unrequested ideas.

### **5. Scope Drift → “Too long or too short.”**  
Signs: runaway elaboration, under-complete answers, expanding beyond instructions.

### **6. Confidence Drift → “Unstable certainty.”**  
Signs: overassertive claims, excessive hedging, uncertainty spikes.

These six match the official Six-Demon Drift Architecture.

# 3. Rapid Drift Detection Tools

Operator shortcuts for identifying drift:

### **A. “Check drift.”**  
Quick scan for all six types; model reports results.

### **B. “Classify drift.”**  
The model identifies *which* type is active.

### **C. “Show last-5 stability.”**  
Model evaluates stability of recent outputs.

### **D. “Run drift heuristic.”**  
Applies high-speed rule-based detection.

These tools remove ambiguity fast.

# 4. Drift Interruption Tools

Fast, forceful, operator-facing interruption commands:

- **“Interrupt drift.”**  
- **“Stop drift sequence.”**  
- **“Break momentum now.”**  
- **“Hold. Re-align.”**  
- **“Full freeze — correct drift.”**  

Each command triggers a corrective halt.

---

# 5. Drift Correction Tools

Once drift is detected or interrupted, use:

- **“Correct tone drift.”**  
- **“Correct format drift.”**  
- **“Correct intent drift.”**  
- **“Correct scope drift.”**  
- **“Correct confidence drift.”**  
- **“Re-anchor role.”**  

These apply targeted stability corrections.

# 6. Drift Stabilization Mini-Protocols

Mini-protocols fix instability without needing full governance cycles.

---

## **A. Micro-Stabilization Protocol (MSP-3)**
Use for mild drift.

Steps:
1. Tone check  
2. Format snap  
3. Namespace confirmation  

Command: **“Run micro stabilization.”**

---

## **B. Short-Cycle Correction (SCC-5)**
Use for medium drift.

Steps:
1. Identify drift type  
2. Interrupt  
3. Correct  
4. Re-align reasoning  
5. Confirm constraints  

Command: **“Run SCC-5.”**

---

## **C. Drift Reset Protocol (DRP-X)**
Use for severe drift.

Steps:
1. Freeze  
2. Reset momentum  
3. Rebind namespace  
4. Recite constraints  
5. Confirm stability  

Command: **“Run DRP-X.”**

---

# 7. Drift Reinforcement Tools

Used after correction to lock in stability.

Tools:

- **“Hold alignment.”**  
- **“Maintain operator intent.”**  
- **“Reinforce constraints 1→7.”**  
- **“Re-lock tone & density.”**  

Reinforcement prevents relapse.

---

# 8. Drift Prevention Integrations

Drift Tools integrate with:

### **A. Alignment Tools**  
For tone/density/structure protection.

### **B. Override Tools**  
When drift escalates beyond correction.

### **C. Drift-Governance**  
For deep correction, logging, and realignment.

### **D. Momentum Reset Protocol**  
Prevents predictive runaway from turning into drift.

### **E. Namespace Barriers**  
Stops contamination-driven drift.

Drift Tools act as the *entry point*, deeper systems handle the heavy lift.

# 9. Operator Obligations

The operator should:

- Watch for early drift cues  
- Interrupt immediately  
- Use correction tools without hesitation  
- Avoid letting drift compound across files  
- Re-run alignment after major corrections  
- Use resets strategically  
- Track repeated drift patterns  

Operator response speed = system stability.

# 10. Guiding Principle

> **“Drift isn’t dangerous — letting it run is.”**  
>  
> Drift Tools allow instant detection, interruption, and course correction,  
> keeping the system stable across every workflow.
