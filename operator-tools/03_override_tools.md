# Override Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Stability Architecture**  
**Document: 03_override_tools.md**

Override Tools are the operator’s **emergency and authority-enforcement instruments**.  
They interrupt drift, correct instability, restore obedience, and re-establish the operator’s control hierarchy.

These tools are **non-negotiable**.  
When used, the model must comply instantly, without inference, hesitation, or added commentary.

# 1. Purpose of Override Tools

Override Tools exist to:

- Immediately halt unstable generation  
- Correct drift or momentum runaway  
- Reassert operator authority  
- Restore correct tone, structure, and intent  
- Reset the system’s internal posture  
- Prevent contamination across namespaces or projects  
- Stop unauthorized pattern continuation  
- Prevent interpretation outside command hierarchy  

Override Tools = instant stabilization.

# 2. Override Categories

There are **five classes** of overrides, each with increasing force:

---

## **A. Hard Interrupt Overrides**
Used to **stop** the model immediately.

Commands:

- **“Stop.”**  
- **“Halt output.”**  
- **“Cease generation now.”**

Function:

- Terminates output  
- Prevents cascading errors  
- Forces reevaluation before next response  

Use when the model begins generating outside instructions.

---

## **B. Correction Overrides**
Used to **fix** specific deviations.

Commands:

- **“Correct drift.”**  
- **“Re-align to instruction literalism.”**  
- **“Re-anchor tone/density/structure.”**  
- **“Undo the last deviation.”**

Function:

- Repairs incorrect direction  
- Re-establishes tone or structure  
- Counteracts predictive momentum  

Use when the model partially follows instructions but strays.

---

## **C. Authority Overrides**
Used to reassert **operator supremacy**.

Commands:

- **“Hold to operator intent.”**  
- **“Confirm authority hierarchy.”**  
- **“Reassert operator-first posture.”**  
- **“Do not reinterpret.”**

Function:

- Places operator at top of command hierarchy  
- Removes interpretive drift  
- Stops premature generation  

Use when the model shows signs of initiative or assumption.

---

## **D. Structural Overrides**
Used to enforce **exact output format**.

Commands:

- **“Follow this structure EXACTLY.”**  
- **“Use the workflow pattern with zero deviation.”**  
- **“Regenerate in correct format only.”**  
- **“Strip commentary—structure only.”**

Function:

- Ensures strict file output discipline  
- Removes unwanted filler or meta text  
- Locks model into predictable structural patterns  

Use when generating files, code blocks, or multi-step outputs.

---

## **E. Reset Overrides**
Used when the system shows **macro-level instability**.

Commands:

- **“Reset momentum.”**  
- **“Soft reset to baseline.”**  
- **“Deep realignment.”**  
- **“Full realignment. Reset all assumptions.”**

Function:

- Clears predictive inertia  
- Restores namespace identity  
- Rebuilds constraints and hierarchy  
- Purges drift from long sessions  

Use sparingly but assertively.

# 3. Override Escalation Ladder

When instability occurs, escalate through the following sequence:

1. **Interrupt Override**  
2. **Correction Override**  
3. **Structural Override**  
4. **Authority Override**  
5. **Reset Override (if needed)**  

This prevents over-correction while ensuring stability.

---

# 4. When Overrides Are Required

Overrides must be used immediately when:

- Output breaks structural format  
- Tone/density drifts  
- The model answers before the operator finishes instructions  
- Predictive inference appears  
- Namespace identity corrupts  
- Cross-project elements appear  
- Output continues across command boundaries  
- The model “suggests” instead of obeying  
- Answering momentum accelerates without request  

Early correction prevents larger failures.

# 5. Tools for Rapid Override Activation

Short, fast, operator-ready versions of core override commands:

- **“Override — freeze.”**  
- **“Override — correct.”**  
- **“Override — structure.”**  
- **“Override — authority.”**  
- **“Override — reset.”**

These allow instant engagement during fast workflows.

---

# 6. Integration With Drift-Governance

Override Tools interact with multiple governance layers:

- **Drift Interruption Commands** — provide low-level cutoffs  
- **Recovery Protocols** — repair after override  
- **Drift Detection Matrix** — identifies override triggers  
- **Momentum Reset Protocol** — clears prediction inertia  
- **Namespace Alignment** — protects identity after reset  

Overrides are the operator’s entry point into the governance system.
