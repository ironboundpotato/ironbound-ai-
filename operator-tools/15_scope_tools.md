# Scope Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Scope Regulation Module**  
**Document: 15_scope_tools.md**

Scope Tools regulate *how wide* or *narrow* the system is allowed to think, reason, or generate.  
Scope determines the permitted domain of action, preventing uncontrolled expansion and maintaining task integrity.

Scope is the boundary.  
Task completion depends on holding that boundary.

# 1. Purpose of Scope Tools

Scope Tools ensure:

- No runaway expansion of tasks  
- No unintentional deep dives  
- No multi-problem blending  
- Clear containment of objectives  
- Smooth scaling (zooming in/out)  
- Alignment with operator-defined guardrails  

Scope failures cause cascading reasoning breakdowns.  
Scope control prevents them.

# 2. Scope Command Set

Direct operator commands include:

- **“Set scope to X.”**  
- **“Hold scope.”**  
- **“Narrow the scope.”**  
- **“Expand scope one layer.”**  
- **“Do not exceed defined scope.”**  
- **“Return to assigned scope.”**  
- **"Correct scope drift."**  

All scope changes must be operator-led, never assumed.

# 3. Types of Scope Drift

### **A. Expansion Drift**  
Model attempts to solve adjacent or larger problems.

### **B. Contraction Drift**  
Model becomes too narrow, missing required components.

### **C. Blending Drift**  
Multiple scopes merge into one ungoverned task.

### **D. Recursive Drift**  
The task keeps spawning sub-tasks endlessly.

Each type threatens structural coherence and must be contained.

---

# 4. Scope Diagnostics

Tools to identify scope issues:

- **“Run scope check.”**  
- **“Identify scope violations.”**  
- **“Highlight out-of-scope segments.”**  
- **“Show boundary breaches.”**  
- **“Locate sub-task overgrowth.”**  

Diagnostics reveal where containment failed.

---

# 5. Scope Restoration Tools

When drift is detected, use:

### **A. Boundary Reset**
Re-establishes the original task edges.

### **B. Focus Re-Centering**
Returns the reasoning to the core objective.

### **C. Task Isolation**
Separates blended scopes into distinct containers.

### **D. Layer Compression**
Reduces unnecessary sub-layers of analysis.

### **E. Scope Clarification**
Re-states the exact boundaries in operator-approved terms.

These restore discipline to reasoning.

---

# 6. Scope Filters

Filters used to shape and enforce scope:

### **A. Domain Filter**
Restricts thinking to one field or namespace.

### **B. Depth Filter**
Limits how many layers deep the system may reason.

### **C. Breadth Filter**
Limits how wide the conceptual exploration can fan out.

### **D. Temporal Filter**
Prevents unrelated timeframes from entering the task.

### **E. Relevance Filter**
Removes tangential or adjacent topics.

Filters keep the system tight and on-mission.

---

# 7. Scoped Workflow Modes

### **Mode 1 — Point Scope**
Single-task focus.  
No branching.

### **Mode 2 — Local Scope**
Allows short, contained expansions.

### **Mode 3 — Layered Scope**
Multiple layers allowed if directly relevant.

### **Mode 4 — Global Scope**
Only allowed when explicitly commanded.  
Used for architecture, world-building, or system-wide integration.

Scope mode is always operator-selected.

# 8. Scoped Reset Tools

Reset types used without destructive context loss:

- **“Soft scope reset.”**  
Clears drift; preserves task.

- **“Scope boundary restore.”**  
Rebuilds the original perimeter.

- **“Scope isolation reset.”**  
Separates entangled tasks back into clean lanes.

Scoped resets prevent full session collapse.

---

# 9. Multi-Step Scope Integrity

For multi-stage workflows, scope must hold across steps.

Tools:

- **“Maintain scope continuity.”**  
- **“Prevent cross-step bleed.”**  
- **“Lock scope until final output.”**  

This is essential for protocols, pipelines, and multi-file generation.

---

# 10. Cross-Namespace Scope Protection

Each namespace (frameworks, fiction, tools, philosophy, etc.) has its own allowed scope bandwidth.

Commands:

- **“Protect namespace scope.”**  
- **“Reject out-of-namespace expansion.”**  
- **“Hold this thread within its defined domain.”**  

Scope must never migrate without operator direction.
