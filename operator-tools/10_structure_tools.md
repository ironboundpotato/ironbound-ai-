# Structure Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Stability Architecture**  
**Document: 10_structure_tools.md**

Structure Tools govern the skeleton of the system’s output.  
Where precision controls accuracy and alignment controls tone, **structure controls shape**.

Without structural discipline, drift compounds — and workflows collapse.

Structure = containment.  
Containment = stability.

# 1. Purpose of Structure Tools

Structure Tools ensure:

- Outputs follow required templates  
- Formatting stay consistent across documents  
- Multi-step workflows retain coherence  
- The model cannot “freeform” into drift  
- Canonical scaffolds remain intact  
- Complex documents maintain layout integrity  

Structure makes large-scale systems possible.

# 2. Structural Control Commands

Commands that directly regulate output architecture:

- **“Maintain structural frame.”**  
- **“Follow exact template.”**  
- **“Replicate formatting precisely.”**  
- **“Do not alter headings or hierarchy.”**  
- **“Use strict markdown compliance.”**  

These prevent format drift — one of the earliest drift signals.

# 3. Template Enforcement

Used when the operator provides a layout the model must obey.

Commands:

- **“Enforce template.”**  
- **“Populate this scaffold without modification.”**  
- **“Hold fixed structure; fill content only.”**  

Templates override improvisation.

# 4. Structural Layers

Every output has three structural layers:

1. **Macro-Structure**  
   - Overall document layout  
   - Section hierarchy  
   - File ordering  

2. **Meso-Structure**  
   - Paragraph organization  
   - Subheadings  
   - Nested lists  

3. **Micro-Structure**  
   - Sentence-level arrangement  
   - Formatting details  
   - Inline consistency  

Structure Tools regulate all three simultaneously.

# 5. Structural Scaffolding Tools

Used for building multi-stage frameworks or long documents.

Tools:

- **“Generate scaffold only.”**  
- **“Outline full structure before writing.”**  
- **“Lock scaffold.”**  
- **“Expand section X only.”**  

These allow huge documents to be built safely in controlled passes.

---

# 6. Structural Correction Tools

Used when the model begins drifting in formatting or layout.

Commands:

- **“Correct structural inconsistencies.”**  
- **“Restore section hierarchy.”**  
- **“Align formatting with previous pattern.”**  
- **“Rebuild structure without altering content.”**  

Structural correction reverses early-stage drift.

---

# 7. Structure Validation Tools

Tools for auditing structure:

- **“Run structure audit.”**  
- **“Identify formatting deviations.”**  
- **“List hierarchy errors.”**  
- **“Report off-template regions.”**  

These checks catch silent structure drift.

---

# 8. Structural Adaptation Tools

Used when operator wants the model to adjust structure without drifting.

Tools:

- **“Reformat this into X structure.”**  
- **“Convert to numbered hierarchy.”**  
- **“Translate into scaffold-only mode.”**  
- **“Rebuild layout preserving all information.”**  

Structure adapts; content stays stable.

---

# 9. Multi-Document Structural Synchronization

Used to maintain consistency across entire repositories.

Tools:

- **“Synchronize structure with file X.”**  
- **“Match formatting conventions across namespace.”**  
- **“Unify section hierarchy across documents.”**  

Essential for large frameworks like IRONBOUND-AI.

---

# 10. Structure Locking

When structure must not change at all.

Commands:

- **“Lock structure.”**  
- **“Disallow format modification.”**  
- **“Freeze layout; content only may change.”**  

This prevents accidental reformatting during edits.

---

# 11. Integration With Other Subsystems

### **Precision Tools**  
Structure defines *where* precision applies.

### **Alignment Tools**  
Tone and density must sit inside the correct scaffolding.

### **Session Tools**  
Structure drift often emerges in long sessions.

### **Memory Tools**  
Canon structures must be preserved exactly.

Structure is the backbone connecting all systems.

# 12. Guiding Principle

> **“If structure fails, everything fails.”**
