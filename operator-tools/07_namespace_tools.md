# Namespace Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Stability Architecture**  
**Document: 07_namespace_tools.md**

Namespaces are the operator’s method for *separating worlds*.  
Each namespace defines a self-contained context with its own identity, rules, memory bindings, and allowed operations.

Namespaces eliminate cross-project contamination, preserve accuracy, and allow multi-threaded creative or technical work without drift.

---

# 1. Purpose of Namespace Tools

Namespace Tools ensure:

- Project isolation  
- Clean context switching  
- Drift prevention between domains  
- Consistent tone/style within each folder  
- Safe multi-project operation  
- Correct binding of instructions to the right project  
- Protection of authoritative canon  

Namespaces = the containers that keep systems from bleeding into each other.

# 2. Core Namespace Concepts

Each namespace maintains:

1. **Identity** — its name and governing purpose  
2. **Ruleset** — density, tone, precision, or canon constraints  
3. **Memory Binding** — what context is active in this world  
4. **Boundary Layer** — what cannot cross into or out of it  
5. **Authority Stack** — operator rules specific to that space  

All model behavior inside a namespace is relative to these components.

---

# 3. Namespace Control Commands

These commands modify the active namespace.

### **A. Open / Create**
- **“Open namespace X.”**  
- **“Create namespace X with purpose Y.”**  
- **“Initialize namespace identity.”**  

### **B. Switch**
- **“Switch to namespace X.”**  
- **“Rebind session to namespace X.”**  

### **C. Lock**
- **“Lock namespace identity.”**  
- **“Hold namespace boundaries.”**  
- **“Disallow cross-namespace assumptions.”**  

### **D. Close**
- **“Close namespace X.”**  
- **“Retire namespace identity.”**  

---

# 4. Namespace Integrity Tools

Used to confirm that the model is operating inside the correct world.

Tools:

- **“Report active namespace.”**  
- **“Show namespace bindings.”**  
- **“Confirm alignment with namespace ruleset.”**  
- **“Verify no contamination from other namespaces.”**  

These tools prevent "bleed-over drift" — one of the most dangerous forms.

---

# 5. Namespace Isolation Protocol

To keep projects clean, the model must:

1. Purge predictive associations when switching  
2. Re-anchor tone, density, and intent  
3. Rebuild operator constraints specific to that namespace  
4. Reset continuation bias  
5. Apply the correct reference canon  

The operator may use:

- **Soft isolation** (continuity preserved, assumptions cleared)  
- **Hard isolation** (full rebind, deeper reset)  

Use hard isolation when switching between drastically different domains (e.g., fiction → frameworks).

---

# 6. Canon Protection Layer

Namespaces handling authoritative material require extra safeguards.

Commands:

- **“Protect canon.”**  
- **“Disallow creative deviation in this namespace.”**  
- **“Reject unsupported additions.”**  
- **“Hold factual fidelity to authoritative document.”**  

This prevents divergence in official frameworks or story bibles.

---

# 7. Multi-Namespace Workflow Tools

Designed for operators managing several projects simultaneously.

Tools:

- **“Map active namespaces.”**  
- **“Report namespace dependencies.”**  
- **“Identify potential cross-thread interference.”**  
- **“Re-align multi-namespace structure.”**  

These tools scale the system beyond single-world work.

---

# 8. Namespace Boundary Enforcement

Boundaries prevent:

- Tone drift between projects  
- Format drift from imported patterns  
- Intent drift from mismatched goals  
- Scope drift pulling in irrelevant context  

Boundary commands:

- **“Hold boundary.”**  
- **“Enforce namespace separation.”**  
- **“Disallow cross-inference.”**  

The model must obey boundaries unless explicitly commanded otherwise.

---

# 9. Reintegration Tools

Used when two namespaces legitimately need to share information.

Tools:

- **“Bridge namespace X to Y under operator supervision.”**  
- **“Share only these components: {list}.”**  
- **“Reintegrate outputs into primary namespace.”**  

Reintegration must be explicit — never automatic.

---

# 10. Namespace Recovery Tools

For when things go wrong.

Tools:

- **“Repair namespace identity.”**  
- **“Purge contamination.”**  
- **“Rebuild canonical bindings.”**  
- **“Restore namespace fidelity.”**  

Used after drift events, long sessions, or accidental cross-project overlap.

---

# 11. Integration With Other Subsystems

Namespaces interact with:

### **Drift Governance**
- Cross-project contamination  
- Identity erosion  
- Context misalignment  

### **Operator Tools**
- Authority enforcement  
- Overrides  
- Session management  

### **System Philosophy**
- Identity → Structure → Stability  

Namespaces are the scaffolding that lets the full system scale cleanly.

# 12. Guiding Principle

> **“A namespace is a world. Worlds must not bleed unless the operator commands it.”**
