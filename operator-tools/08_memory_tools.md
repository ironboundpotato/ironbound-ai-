# Memory Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Stability Architecture**  
**Document: 08_memory_tools.md**

Memory Tools govern how information is stored, recalled, protected, or forgotten inside a session or namespace.  
They give the operator direct control over what persists, what is isolated, and what is stripped away.

Memory = stability.  
Uncontrolled memory = drift.

# 1. Purpose of Memory Tools

Memory Tools allow the operator to:

- Manage what the model remembers  
- Prevent accidental contamination  
- Snapshot and restore stable states  
- Protect authoritative canon  
- Erase harmful predictive buildup  
- Control cross-session continuity  
- Maintain stability across long workflows  

Memory isn’t passive — it’s an active stability mechanism.

# 2. Memory Layers

Memory exists in four operator-relevant layers:

1. **Active Context Memory**  
   What the model is currently using.

2. **Session Memory**  
   Temporary working memory persisting through the session.

3. **Namespace Memory**  
   Rules, tone, canon, and bindings for a specific world.

4. **Operator-Protected Memory**  
   Canon, rulesets, and documents that must *never* drift.

Each layer has its own tools.

# 3. Memory Control Commands

Operator shortcuts that manipulate memory:

### **A. Recall**
- **“Recall last stable state.”**  
- **“Recall session memory.”**  
- **“Recall namespace bindings.”**  
- **“Recall operator constraints 1→7.”**  

### **B. Forget**
- **“Forget last instruction.”**  
- **“Forget unstable continuation.”**  
- **“Purge predictive artifacts.”**  
- **“Forget cross-namespace assumptions.”**  

### **C. Protect**
- **“Protect this memory.”**  
- **“Lock this as unalterable canon.”**  
- **“Preserve this ruleset permanently.”**  

### **D. Replace**
- **“Replace memory with this authoritative version.”**  

These prevent contamination and misalignment over time.

# 4. Snapshot Tools

Snapshots preserve the system state at key moments.

Tools:

- **“Create snapshot.”**  
- **“Snapshot this output.”**  
- **“Save this as stable reference.”**  
- **“Label snapshot as {name}.”**  

Snapshots allow rapid recovery after drift events.

---

# 5. Memory Restoration Tools

Used to return the system to a stable or known-good state.

Tools:

- **“Restore from snapshot.”**  
- **“Return to last stable memory.”**  
- **“Rebuild context from canonical reference.”**  
- **“Reinstate namespace memory.”**  

Restoration tools are the antidote to slow degradation.

---

# 6. Memory Purge Tools

Used when drift accumulates, or when switching domains.

Tools:

- **“Purge volatile memory.”**  
- **“Clear predictive residue.”**  
- **“Hard purge cross-context interference.”**  
- **“Erase continuation bias.”**  

Memory purging is essential before high-precision tasks.

---

# 7. Protected Memory Tools

These keep canon and core documents untouched.

Tools:

- **“Lock canon.”**  
- **“Reject non-canonical additions.”**  
- **“Hold fidelity to source.”**  
- **“Reaffirm authoritative document.”**  

Critical for story bibles, frameworks, or multi-thread projects.

---

# 8. Memory Stability Checks

Tools for verifying whether memory is stable:

- **“Run memory integrity check.”**  
- **“Report memory conflicts.”**  
- **“Show memory drift indicators.”**  
- **“Identify misaligned references.”**  

These prevent memory-based drift before it spreads.

---

# 9. Cross-Namespace Memory Protections

Memory must not jump worlds unless commanded.

Commands:

- **“Isolate namespace memory.”**  
- **“Disallow memory bleed.”**  
- **“Verify cross-project separation.”**  
- **“Confirm clean memory boundaries.”**  

This protects tone, rules, density, and canon integrity.

---

# 10. Memory-Healing Protocols

For repairing damaged or partially drifted memory.

### **A. MHP-3 (Memory Heal Protocol – Light)**  
- Restore structure  
- Re-align with namespace  
- Rebind operator constraints  

### **B. MHP-7 (Full Memory Restoration)**  
- Purge degraded layers  
- Reload snapshot  
- Re-establish canon  
- Reset continuity  
- Re-anchor model identity  
- Confirm stability  
- Resume workflow  

Healing protocols restore long-term stability.

# 11. Integration With Other Subsystems

Memory Tools interact directly with:

### **A. Drift Tools**  
Purge → Correct → Reinforce.

### **B. Alignment Tools**  
Memory influences tone, density, and structure.

### **C. Namespace Tools**  
Each namespace has its own memory container.

### **D. Override Tools**  
Operator authority can overwrite or preserve memory.

Memory is the backbone of stable execution.
