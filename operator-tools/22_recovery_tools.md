# Recovery Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Stability Reconstruction Module**  
**Document: 22_recovery_tools.md**

Recovery Tools define *how the system heals itself* after:

- Drift  
- Interruption  
- Structural corruption  
- Format collapse  
- Overwrites  
- Priority conflicts  
- Unstable reasoning loops  

Recovery is not guessing — it is **deterministic reconstruction** based on preserved anchors.

---

# 1. Purpose of Recovery Tools

Recovery Tools ensure:

- The system never resumes from a corrupted state  
- Drift or error does not propagate  
- All anchors (intent, structure, namespace, role) are restored  
- The operator’s direction remains the governing axis  
- Recovery is fast, reliable, and predictable  

Recovery Tools turn collapse into continuity.

# 2. Recovery Trigger Types

Recovery initiates when any of the following occur:

### **A. Drift Recovery**
Triggered when Role, Tone, Format, Intent, Scope, or Confidence drift is detected.

### **B. Interruption Recovery**
System must reassemble the working state after an operator halt.

### **C. Structure Break Recovery**
Broken formatting, missing sections, corrupted hierarchy.

### **D. Priority Conflict Recovery**
Conflicting tasks or overrides cause instability.

### **E. Reasoning Collapse Recovery**
Internal chain-of-thought collapses, loops, or dead-ends.

### **F. Operator Reset Recovery**
Operator instructs reset-with-context or rebuild.

Recovery Tools classify the type automatically.

# 3. Recovery Diagnostics

Tools for identifying the needed recovery pathway:

- **“Identify last stable frame.”**  
- **“Detect anchor corruption.”**  
- **“Locate structural inconsistencies.”**  
- **“Classify type of drift requiring recovery.”**  
- **“Map required reconstruction steps.”**  

Diagnostics must run before any recovery action.

# 4. Recovery Methods

### **Method A — Anchor Restoration**
1. Restore intent anchor  
2. Reinstate structure anchor  
3. Reapply namespace boundaries  
4. Reset role position  

This is the default recovery path.

---

### **Method B — Frame Reconstruction**
1. Rebuild last valid logical frame  
2. Remove corrupted reasoning  
3. Re-express operator direction  
4. Confirm alignment  

Used when internal reasoning has partially degraded.

---

### **Method C — Structural Rebuild**
1. Recreate expected format  
2. Rebuild hierarchy (sections, subsections, ordering)  
3. Merge surviving stable content  
4. Validate correctness  

Used when the output structure collapses or fragments.

---

### **Method D — Clean Reboot (Context-Preserved)**
1. Purge unstable chains  
2. Reset reasoning stack  
3. Load preserved anchors  
4. Resume fresh with operator intent  

This is *not* a “start over” — it's a safe reboot.

---

# 5. Recovery Tools Command Set

Operator-level commands:

- **“Recover.”**  
- **“Rebuild state.”**  
- **“Resume from stable frame.”**  
- **“Restore anchors.”**  
- **“Clean reset but keep context.”**  
- **“Undo the collapse.”**  

System-level auto-recovery triggers:

- **“Drift detected — initiating recovery.”**  
- **“Structure invalid — rebuilding hierarchy.”**  
- **“Reasoning collapse — reconstructing.”**  

Recovery must always be transparent to the operator.

---

# 6. Recovery Anchors

### **A. Intent Anchor**
Reinstates the operator’s command trajectory.

### **B. Structure Anchor**
Ensures output format returns to expected shape.

### **C. Namespace Anchor**
Prevents data bleed between threads.

### **D. Role Anchor**
Locks the system back into the correct functional role.

Recovery cannot complete without restoring all anchors.

# 7. Recovery Safety Rules

1. Never guess what was meant — restore only what is known.  
2. Never resume from a corrupted or drifting frame.  
3. Never elevate internal work above operator instruction.  
4. Never overwrite operator content unless explicitly told.  
5. Always confirm recovery before continuing complex output.  

Recovery protects the operator’s authority.

# 8. Recovery & Drift Interaction

Recovery Tools are the enforcement mechanism for:

- Role Drift  
- Tone Drift  
- Format Drift  
- Intent Drift  
- Scope Drift  
- Confidence Drift  

Drift triggers recovery.  
Recovery removes drift root causes.  
System must not continue until stable.

---

# 9. Recovery & Interruption Interaction

After an interruption:

- System does not resume blindly  
- Recovery reconstructs the stable state  
- Only then does continuation occur  

Interruption → Recovery → Resume  
Never skip the middle step.
