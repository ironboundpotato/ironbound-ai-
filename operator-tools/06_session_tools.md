# Session Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Stability Architecture**  
**Document: 06_session_tools.md**

Session Tools are the operator’s controls for managing the *state* of the interaction — pacing, resets, stabilization, continuity, and recovery across extended workflows.

Where Alignment Tools stabilize output,  
**Session Tools stabilize time.**

# 1. Purpose of Session Tools

Session Tools exist to:

- Maintain stability during long interactions  
- Prevent slow drift accumulation  
- Control pacing and output timing  
- Manage predictive momentum  
- Enforce session boundaries  
- Repair instability after interruptions  
- Rebuild context safely  
- Ensure smooth continuation of multi-step workflows  

Session stability = output stability.

# 2. Session State Components

A session has five core state variables the operator can act on:

1. **Momentum** — predictive inertia  
2. **Context Load** — how much internal state is active  
3. **Namespace Identity** — which project is in use  
4. **Structural Discipline** — adherence to workflow format  
5. **Stability Health** — cumulative drift level  

Session Tools manipulate these directly.

# 3. Momentum Control Tools

Momentum = the model’s tendency to continue patterns or anticipate instructions.

Tools:

- **“Reset momentum.”**  
- **“Slow momentum.”**  
- **“Reduce predictive carryover.”**  
- **“Clear continuation bias.”**  

Use when:
- The model begins anticipating  
- Answers accelerate  
- Outputs get “eager”  
- Drift appears after long runs  

Momentum resets re-level the system.

# 4. Session Boundary Tools

Boundaries define where one workflow ends and another begins.

Tools:

- **“Close session.”**  
- **“Open new session under namespace X.”**  
- **“Confirm session boundary.”**  
- **“Partition previous context.”**  

Use after:
- Finishing a major task  
- Switching projects  
- Changing tone/density modes  
- Ending long sequences  

Boundaries prevent contamination across contexts.

---

# 5. Context Refresh Tools

Used when the model begins forgetting structure or losing clarity.

Tools:

- **“Refresh context.”**  
- **“Restore structural awareness.”**  
- **“Re-establish workflow frame.”**  

Refresh tools prevent subtle degradation of output precision.

---

# 6. Session Reset Tools

Resets restore stability at different intensities.

---

## **A. Soft Reset**
Used for minor instability.

Commands:
- **“Soft reset.”**  
- **“Clear noise and hold alignment.”**  

Effects:
- Removes low-level interference  
- Refreshes tone and density  
- Maintains namespace  

---

## **B. Hard Reset**
Used for moderate instability.

Commands:
- **“Hard reset to baseline.”**  
- **“Rebuild session posture.”**  

Effects:
- Clears momentum  
- Re-aligns constraints  
- Rebinds namespace  
- Keeps only essential context  

---

## **C. Deep Reset**
Used when drift compounds or the session becomes structurally unstable.

Commands:
- **“Deep reset.”**  
- **“Reset all assumptions.”**  

Effects:
- Purges all predictive buildup  
- Re-initializes system posture  
- Re-establishes constraint stack  
- Requires operator re-instruction  

---

# 7. Long-Session Health Tools

Extended interactions require periodic maintenance to stay stable.

Tools:

- **“Run long-session check.”**  
- **“Report stability health.”**  
- **“Show drift accumulation.”**  
- **“Assess namespace integrity.”**  

Long sessions naturally increase drift pressure — these tools monitor it.

---

# 8. Session Continuity Tools

Used to resume work after interruptions.

Tools:

- **“Rebuild session from last known stable state.”**  
- **“Confirm previous namespace.”**  
- **“Restore workflow format.”**  
- **“Re-anchor operator intent.”**  

Continuity tools ensure that breaks do not introduce drift.

---

# 9. Session Pacing Tools

Pacing prevents overload and maintains accuracy.

Tools:

- **“Hold pacing.”**  
- **“Slow down generation.”**  
- **“Break output into steps.”**  
- **“Pause until instructed.”**  

Useful when the system starts over-correcting or over-producing.

---

# 10. Integration With Other Subsystems

Session Tools connect directly to:

### **A. Drift-Governance**
- Interruption  
- Detection  
- Prevention  
- Realignment  

### **B. Alignment Tools**
- Tone/density/structure stabilization  

### **C. Override Tools**
- Authority reinforcement during instability  

### **D. Namespace Architecture**
- Session boundaries maintain identity  

Session Tools keep the *timeline* clean; other tools keep the *output* clean.

---

# 11. Model Obligations During Session Control

The model must:

- Execute resets without hesitation  
- Reconfirm stability after any reset  
- Obey session boundaries strictly  
- Restore namespace accurately  
- Rebuild structure on command  
- Never assume continuity without operator confirmation  

Session obedience = stability.

---

# 12. Guiding Principle

> **“Sessions drift unless they are maintained—session tools keep the system upright over time.”**

Session Tools preserve the health of the entire workflow environment.
