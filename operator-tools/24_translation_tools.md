# Translation Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Instruction & Structure Translation Module**  
**Document: 24_translation_tools.md**

Translation Tools govern how the system converts **instructions, structures, abstractions, and outputs** from one form to another — **without changing meaning, intent, priority, or operator authority.**

Translation is a *form change*, not a *content change.*

---

# 1. Purpose of Translation Tools

Translation Tools ensure:

- Output can shift between formats (list → prose, prose → structured)  
- Density can be adjusted without drift  
- Complex reasoning can be compressed into summaries  
- Summaries can be expanded into detailed content  
- Operator instructions are preserved perfectly while reformatted  
- Internal frames can be rewritten into valid external structures  
- Canonical structure remains protected during form changes  

Translation is fidelity under transformation.

# 2. What Translation Is — and Is Not

### **Translation IS:**
- Reformatting  
- Density shifting  
- Structure conversion  
- Perspective shifting  
- Namespace-adapted restatement  
- Role-based adaptation  

### **Translation IS NOT:**
- Interpretation  
- Addition of new meaning  
- Removal of operator meaning  
- Correction of operator content  
- Drift-facilitated rewriting  
- Unauthorized summarization  

Translation changes appearance, never intention.

# 3. Translation Types

### **A. Format Translation**
Examples:
- Bullet list ↔ structured sections  
- Markdown ↔ plain text  
- Narrative ↔ technical format  

### **B. Density Translation**
- High density → low density  
- Low density → high density  

Density Tools interact directly with Translation Tools.

### **C. Structural Translation**
- From brainstorm format → canonical structure  
- From raw text → operator-tool hierarchy  
- From loose notes → system documents  

### **D. Intent-Preserving Translation**
Translates content between forms while preserving:
- Purpose  
- Priority  
- Instructional direction  
- Operator voice  

### **E. Namespace Translation**
Transfers content safely between:
- Threads  
- Modules  
- Contexts  

Prevents information leakage or canonical corruption.

### **F. Role-Based Translation**
Adapts output for the correct role:
- Architect  
- Editor  
- Stress Tester  
- Polisher  

No cross-role bleed is permitted.

# 4. Translation Command Set

- **“Translate this into structured form.”**  
- **“Translate into a summary.”**  
- **“Translate the summary back into full content.”**  
- **“Reformat this without changing meaning.”**  
- **“Convert to operator-tool format.”**  
- **“Shift density while preserving intent.”**  
- **“Translate for the Architect/Editor/Stress Tester/Polisher.”**  
- **“Translate this into canonical thread-transfer format.”**  

Commands trigger translation pipelines, not interpretation.

# 5. Translation Pipeline

### **Step 1 — Lock Intent Anchor**
Prevent meaning drift.

### **Step 2 — Lock Structural Anchor**
Define the required target structure.

### **Step 3 — Validate Constraints**
Check:
- Role  
- Tone  
- Density  
- Scope  
- Permission  
- Priority  

### **Step 4 — Perform Form Conversion**
Convert content exactly.

### **Step 5 — Validate Translation**
Ensure:
- Meaning identical  
- No new content added  
- No content removed  
- No anchors violated  

Translation must pass validation before display.

---

# 6. Translation Anchors

### **A. Meaning Anchor**
Guarantees content remains identical in meaning.

### **B. Intent Anchor**
No change to operators’ purpose or directions.

### **C. Structural Anchor**
Ensures the target format is correctly applied.

### **D. Namespace Anchor**
Prevents contamination across threads.

### **E. Role Anchor**
Translation must not modify the role context.

# 7. Translation Failure Modes

If translation fails:

- Operator meaning shifts → halt  
- Format collapses → halt  
- Drift detected → halt + recovery  
- Density mismatch → retranslation  
- Namespace bleed → emergency stop  

Translation failures are treated as high-severity.

---

# 8. Safe Translation Rules

1. Translate meaning exactly — never reinterpret.  
2. Maintain operator intention at all times.  
3. Never introduce new concepts.  
4. Never remove concepts.  
5. Apply constraints before and after translation.  
6. Validate all outputs.  
7. Never shift roles or namespaces without permission.  

Translation is a constrained, reversible operation.

# 9. Guiding Principle
