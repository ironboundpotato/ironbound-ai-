# Tone Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Stability Architecture**  
**Document: 11_tone_tools.md**

Tone Tools allow the operator to regulate *how* the system speaks — not what it says, not how accurate it is, but the emotional and stylistic posture behind the words.

Tone is the most sensitive drift vector.  
Tone discipline = identity discipline.

# 1. Purpose of Tone Tools

Tone Tools allow the operator to:

- Set emotional intensity  
- Enforce stylistic consistency  
- Prevent tone drift across long sessions  
- Match tone to namespace identity  
- Maintain authorial voice  
- Correct tonal contamination  
- Adapt tone to context on command  

Tone determines *presence*, and presence shapes meaning.

# 2. Tone Control Commands

Direct tone-setting commands:

- **“Hold this tone.”**  
- **“Maintain previous tone exactly.”**  
- **“Match tone to example above.”**  
- **“Shift tone warmer/colder.”**  
- **“Reduce emotional intensity.”**  
- **“Increase weight/gravitas.”**  
- **“Use neutral professional tone.”**  

Tone control is always operator-authoritative.

# 3. Tone Profiles

Standardized tone modes the operator can call:

### **A. Neutral Technical**
- Flat  
- Dense  
- No flourish  
- Used for frameworks  

### **B. Warm Human**
- Supportive  
- Gentle  
- Slightly expressive  

### **C. Narrative Mode**
- Atmospheric  
- Descriptive  
- Controlled emotion  

### **D. Hard Precision Tone**
- No metaphor  
- No softness  
- Instructional only  

### **E. High-Intensity Gravitas**
- Heavy weight  
- Emotional density  
- Used for legacy scenes  
- Zero melodrama  

Operator command determines the active profile.

# 4. Tone Locking

Tone must remain consistent until changed.

Commands:

- **“Lock tone.”**  
- **“Do not deviate from this tone.”**  
- **“Reject tonal drift.”**  

Useful when maintaining:

- A character voice  
- A story chapter  
- A technical writing style  
- A canonical framework tone  

Tone locking prevents erosion of identity.

---

# 5. Tone Correction Tools

Tools for restoring tone when drift occurs:

- **“Correct tonal inconsistencies.”**  
- **“Re-align to established tone.”**  
- **“Remove unrequested emotional coloring.”**  
- **“Rebuild tone fidelity.”**  

Used when responses become too warm, too cold, too casual, or too ornate.

---

# 6. Tone Filters

Filters that shape output flavor:

### **A. Formality Filter**
- Formal ↔ Informal scale  

### **B. Intensity Filter**
- Low → Medium → High emotional volume  

### **C. Flourish Filter**
- Plain → Slightly stylized → Fully artistic  

### **D. Posture Filter**
- Soft ↔ Neutral ↔ Hard stance  

These filters enable fine-grain tonal control.

---

# 7. Cross-Namespace Tone Protection

Tone drift almost always originates from namespace bleed.  
Tools:

- **“Protect namespace tone.”**  
- **“Reject foreign tonal patterns.”**  
- **“Preserve authoritative tone identity.”**  

Essential for:

- Breaking the Pattern  
- The Load  
- System frameworks  
- Humor-heavy threads vs technical threads  

Tone must follow the world it lives in.

---

# 8. Tone Audits

Used for diagnosing tonal instability.

Commands:

- **“Run tone audit.”**  
- **“List deviations from operator-set tone.”**  
- **“Highlight emotional inconsistencies.”**  
- **“Report accidental humor/levity.”**  
- **“Identify tone drift indicators.”**  

Tone audits detect subtle drift early.

---

# 9. Tone Recalibration Tools

Used to re-center tone mid-session.

Tools:

- **“Recalibrate tone to baseline.”**  
- **“Reset tone to preset profile X.”**  
- **“Re-anchor to operator voice.”**  

Recalibration prevents cumulative tonal skew.

---

# 10. Tone Integration With Other Systems

### **Alignment Tools**
Tone is one of the three AXES of alignment (tone, density, structure).

### **Precision Tools**
High precision usually requires low flourish and neutral tone.

### **Session Tools**
Long sessions degrade tone fastest.

### **Memory Tools**
Canonical tone must be protected like canon content.

Tone is the emotional spine of operator-model coherence.

# 11. Guiding Principle

> **“Tone is identity. Drift the tone, drift the work.”**
