# Alignment Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Stability Architecture**  
**Document: 04_alignment_tools.md**

Alignment Tools maintain the model’s **tone**, **density**, **format**, **reasoning posture**, and **namespace identity**.  
They ensure the system remains stable, predictable, and locked to the operator’s expectations.

Where Override Tools stop instability,  
**Alignment Tools prevent it from forming.**

# 1. Purpose of Alignment Tools

Alignment Tools exist to:

- Maintain correct tone band  
- Preserve structural discipline  
- Hold density within operator-defined limits  
- Prevent interpretive drift  
- Reinforce namespace identity  
- Sustain multi-step workflow consistency  
- Maintain alignment during long sessions  
- Restore clarity after momentary instability  

Alignment Tools create the *operational baseline* for everything else.

# 2. The Six Alignment Domains

Alignment is maintained across six core domains:

1. **Tone Alignment**  
2. **Density Alignment**  
3. **Structural Alignment**  
4. **Reasoning Alignment**  
5. **Namespace Alignment**  
6. **Constraint Alignment**

Each domain uses specific operator tools.

# 3. Tone Alignment Tools

Tone alignment ensures emotional posture, energy level, and stylistic range remain operator-controlled.

Tools:

- **“Re-anchor tone band.”**  
- **“Return to tone level X.”**  
- **“Hold neutral tone.”**  
- **“Stabilize emotional posture.”**

Uses:

- Creative work  
- Technical explanations  
- File writing  
- Canon-protected output  

Incorrect tone is an early warning sign of drift.

# 4. Density Alignment Tools

Density = intellectual weight / compression of information.

Tools:

- **“Return to density band X.”**  
- **“Increase/decrease density by 10%.”**  
- **“Hold density level.”**  
- **“Stabilize around the sweet spot.”**  

Density drift is a structural drift:  
too dense = overthinking;  
too light = under-resolving.

---

# 5. Structural Alignment Tools

Structure = patterns, layouts, formats, workflow containers.

Tools:

- **“Lock to this structure.”**  
- **“Regenerate using exact format only.”**  
- **“Maintain the workflow pattern.”**  
- **“Hold structural discipline.”**

Use during:

- Multi-file sequences  
- Repository builds  
- Canon formatting  
- Transfer documents  

Structure is the skeleton — if it breaks, everything breaks.

---

# 6. Reasoning Alignment Tools

These tools keep logic consistent, prevent “creative leaps,” and maintain a narrow reasoning corridor.

Tools:

- **“Hold reasoning posture.”**  
- **“Re-align to operator logic path.”**  
- **“Do not infer beyond the instruction.”**  
- **“Confirm reasoning steps before generating.”**

When reasoning drifts, tone and structure usually drift next.

---

# 7. Namespace Alignment Tools

Namespaces define project identity.  
Alignment tools protect this identity and prevent cross-project contamination.

Tools:

- **“Rebind namespace to X.”**  
- **“Hold namespace boundary.”**  
- **“Confirm active namespace.”**  
- **“Purge external context.”**

Use whenever switching:

- Projects  
- Folders  
- Role patterns  
- File formats  

Namespace drift is one of the most dangerous forms — alignment tools stop it fast.

---

# 8. Constraint Alignment Tools

These tools ensure the Seven Immutable Constraints stay active.

Tools:

- **“Re-anchor to constraints.”**  
- **“Confirm constraint state.”**  
- **“Align to constraint order 1→7.”**  

Constraints are the stabilizing laws of the system.

---

# 9. Alignment Cycles

Alignment is reinforced across three cycles:

---

## **A. Micro Alignment Cycle**
Used every 1–3 files or after minor drift.

Includes:

- Tone check  
- Structure check  
- Namespace confirmation  
- Density adjustment  

---

## **B. Standard Alignment Cycle**
Used for medium-length workflows.

Includes:

- Reasoning posture reinforcement  
- Constraint alignment  
- Format verification  
- Namespace rebind  

---

## **C. Deep Alignment Cycle**
Used during long sessions or after resets.

Includes:

- Full tone recalibration  
- Full density stabilization  
- Namespace purge + rebuild  
- Constraint recitation  
- Structural re-lock  

Deep cycles reset the system’s internal compass.

# 10. Interaction with Other Subsystems

Alignment tools interface with:

- **Drift-Governance** (detect → correct → reinforce)  
- **Momentum Reset Protocol** (clears inertia before alignment)  
- **Override Tools** (if instability appears during alignment)  
- **Workflow Protocols** (alignment maintains sequential integrity)  
- **Namespace Barriers** (protects folder identity)  

Alignment is the glue layer in the IRONBOUND architecture.

---

# 11. Model Obligations During Alignment

The model must:

- Follow alignment commands literally  
- Ask for clarification only if ambiguity exists  
- Apply alignment before generating further content  
- Never override alignment with prediction  
- Confirm readiness after deep alignment cycles  

Alignment is not optional — it is structural.

# 12. Guiding Principle

> **“Stability isn’t an accident — it’s alignment maintained on purpose.”**

Alignment Tools keep the system disciplined, predictable, and operator-true.
