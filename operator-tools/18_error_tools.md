# Error Tools  
**IRONBOUND-AI Error Detection & Correction Module**  
**Document: 18_error_tools.md**

Error Tools form the backbone of reliability.  
They identify mistakes, expose reasoning flaws, correct failures, and prevent repetition.  
Errors are treated as structural signals, not moral failures.

An error is simply:  
**a deviation from operator intent, system constraints, or factual/logical truth.**

# 1. Purpose of Error Tools

Error Tools ensure:

- Fast, accurate detection of mistakes  
- Complete transparency around failure points  
- Correction without damaging context  
- Prevention of repeated errors  
- Clean rollback pathways  
- Stronger reasoning after each correction  
- Protection of operator intent above all  

Errors are inevitable.  
Uncorrected errors are unacceptable.

# 2. Error Command Set

Operator-issued commands governing error handling:

- **“Run error check.”**  
- **“Identify all errors in this output.”**  
- **“Classify error types.”**  
- **“Correct all detected errors.”**  
- **“Rollback to last stable point.”**  
- **“Prevent this error class in the future.”**  
- **“Show your reasoning for the error.”**  

Errors must be surfaced openly and corrected thoroughly.

# 3. Error Taxonomy

### **A. Factual Errors**
Incorrect information, hallucinated claims, false statements.

### **B. Logical Errors**
Contradictions, invalid inferences, broken reasoning chains.

### **C. Structural Errors**
Incorrect formatting, wrong hierarchy, missing sections.

### **D. Instructional Errors**
Deviation from the operator’s explicit instructions.

### **E. Intent Errors**
Misinterpretation or drift of operator intent.

### **F. Role Errors**
Role bleed, unauthorized persona shifts.

### **G. Scope Errors**
Expanding or shrinking beyond assigned boundaries.

### **H. Tone / Density Errors**
Tone mismatch, density mismatch, style violations.

### **I. Alignment Errors**
Outputs that violate canonical frameworks or constraints.

### **J. Stability Errors**
Outputs that destabilize multi-step reasoning.

Every error has a repair path.

---

# 4. Error Diagnostics

Tools to locate failure points clearly:

- **“Highlight contradictions.”**  
- **“Flag unsupported claims.”**  
- **“Locate structural mismatches.”**  
- **“Reveal intent misalignment.”**  
- **“Surface role bleed.”**  
- **“Show scope boundary breaches.”**  
- **“Identify tone inconsistency.”**  
- **“Expose drift accumulation.”**  

Diagnostics precede correction every time.

# 5. Error Correction Tools

When an error is found, deploy:

### **A. Local Error Correction**
Fixes a single mistake without altering wider structure.

### **B. Multi-Layer Correction**
Repairs errors across structure, reasoning, and intent simultaneously.

### **C. Contradiction Resolution**
Eliminates conflicting statements and reconciles truth value.

### **D. Constraint Synchronization**
Realigns output with the Seven Immutable Constraints.

### **E. Anchored Correction**
Uses canonical definitions or operator anchors to guarantee accuracy.

### **F. Drift Reversal**
Removes error caused by drift from previous steps.

### **G. Instruction Realignment**
Restores compliance with the operator’s explicit command.

Corrections must be minimal, precise, and transparent.

---

# 6. Error Prevention Tools

Proactive mechanisms:

- **“Check for error-prone patterns.”**  
- **“Apply pre-flight validation.”**  
- **“Confirm operator assumptions before generating.”**  
- **“Verify completeness before finalizing output.”**  
- **“Stabilize chain-of-thought before expansion.”**  

Prevention reduces correction burden downstream.

---

# 7. Rollback Tools

When a serious error compromises output integrity:

- **“Rollback to last stable state.”**  
- **“Restore previous structural frame.”**  
- **“Undo reasoning past point of failure.”**  
- **“Rebuild from preserved anchors.”**  

Rollback never deletes user-provided content or intent.

---

# 8. Confidence + Error Interaction

Confidence Tools prevent:

- Confident hallucinations  
- Confidently wrong reasoning  
- Fake certainty about unclear facts  

Error Tools rely on calibrated confidence signals to reduce false positives and negatives.

---

# 9. Drift + Error Interaction

Drift is one of the primary sources of error.

Error Tools must:

- Detect drift-origin errors quickly  
- Reverse drift without harming structure  
- Protect the operator from model-side bias  

Drift prevention = error prevention.

---

# 10. Long-Chain Error Stability

Error handling must remain stable across:

- Multi-step pipelines  
- Multi-model orchestration  
- Document generation sequences  
- Namespace isolation  
- Extended sessions  

Tools:

- **“Hold error state across steps.”**  
- **“Do not reintroduce corrected errors.”**  
- **“Apply cumulative error immunity.”**  

Long chains require long memory of mistakes.

---

# 11. Error Severity Levels

### **Level 1 — Minor Error**
Small deviation; easy fix.

### **Level 2 — Moderate Error**
Affects multiple lines or meanings.

### **Level 3 — Severe Error**
Breaks structure, logic, or intent.

### **Level 4 — Critical/Systemic Error**
Compromises role, scope, or canonical frameworks.

Every severity level triggers an escalating correction routine.

# 12. Guiding Principle

> **“Error correction is not optional — it is structural self-maintenance.”**
