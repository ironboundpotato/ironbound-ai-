# System Recovery Model of IRONBOUND-AI (v1.1)
Part of the IRONBOUND-AI Operator Framework  
Version 1.1 • 2026  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (TB)

## Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **recovery procedures** that return IRONBOUND-AI to a stable, obedient, deterministic state after drift, failure, contamination, or collapse.

Where:
- Failure Modes describe *what goes wrong*  
- Boundary Laws describe *what cannot be crossed*  
- Constraint Principles describe *how stability is maintained*  

**System Recovery** describes *how the operator restores control when something breaks.*

Recovery is not optional.  
Recovery is the immune system of IRONBOUND-AI.

# Section 1 — The Recovery Principle

IRONBOUND-AI follows one fundamental recovery principle:

> **Recovery must be faster than drift.**

Drift accelerates.  
Inference compounds.  
Structural corruption spreads.

Recovery must occur **immediately**, not eventually.  
Waiting guarantees collapse.

---

# Section 2 — The Three States of System Failure

Failure presents in three escalation levels:

### **1. Localized Failure**
Small drift, early contamination, light tone softening.  
Detected quickly → corrected easily.

### **2. Distributed Failure**
Multiple sections drifting, cross-role contamination, meaning reframing.  
Requires structured rollback.

### **3. Systemic Failure**
Authority inversion, philosophical mutation, structural collapse.  
Requires full restart and re-priming.

Recovery procedures scale with severity.

# Section 3 — The Seven-Step Recovery Process

Recovery always follows this sequence:

---

## **Step 1 — Stop All Generative Activity**
No more writing, editing, or polishing.  
The first command is always: **STOP.**

Failure spreads during activity.  
Stopping is containment.

---

## **Step 2 — Identify the Failure Mode**
Use the Failure Modes list to pinpoint the pattern.

Typical indicators:
- structural change  
- tonal deviation  
- boundary crossing  
- density shift  
- role contamination  
- inference creep  
- philosophical softening  

Identification = targeting.

---

## **Step 3 — Roll Back to Last Stable Output**
You cannot repair corrupted text.

Recovery rule:  
> **Never fix drifted content — replace it.**

Rollback point = last output before drift appeared.

---

## **Step 4 — Reassert the Seven Immutable Constraints**
Drift weakens constraints.  
Recovery demands they be restated explicitly.

Constraint reassertion resets:
- boundaries  
- density  
- authority bias  
- role purity  
- interpretive limits  

Constraints are the firewall.

---

## **Step 5 — Re-establish Role Purity**
If roles blurred, they must be reset.

Examples:
- Stress Tester diagnosing AND correcting → contamination  
- Editor altering structure → contamination  

Role reset prevents recurrence.

---

## **Step 6 — Reissue Operator Intent**
Intent is always the first casualty of drift.

Re-state:
- purpose  
- density  
- scope  
- constraints  
- role order  

This clears residual inference.

---

## **Step 7 — Resume Workflow Using Lockstep Protocol**
Recovery always ends by restarting the  
**Ironbound Lockstep Protocol**  
to ensure deterministic sequencing.

Never resume mid-pass.  
Mid-pass continuation guarantees relapse.

---

# Section 4 — Emergency Recovery Commands

IRONBOUND-AI supports operator emergency commands:

### **Hard Reset**
“TESUS: HARD RESET. Return to zero-state compliance.”  
Used for severe contamination.

### **Rollback**
“TESUS: Roll back to last non-drifted output.”  
Used for localized drift.

### **Reassert Constraints**
“Reassert constraints 1–7.”  
Used when tone or density has begun softening.

### **Re-establish Roles**
“Reset role boundaries. Architect only.”  
Used when contamination is detected.

These commands restore determinism immediately.

# Section 5 — Recovery for Specific Failure Types

### **Role Contamination**
Solution:  
- stop, identify the contaminated role, reassign tasks, restart sequence.

### **Structural Mutation**
Solution:  
- roll back to pre-mutation structure  
- reassert meta-structure  
- restart with Architect only

### **Density Drift**
Solution:  
- restate density command  
- re-run Editor only after reset

### **Intent Drift**
Solution:  
- restate operator intent verbatim  
- forbid inference, restart workflow

### **Boundary Bleed**
Solution:  
- isolate leaked content  
- restore section snaplines  
- rebuild boundaries
