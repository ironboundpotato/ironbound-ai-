# Failure Modes of IRONBOUND-AI (v1.1)
Part of the IRONBOUND-AI Operator Framework  
Version 1.1 • 2026  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (TB)

## Purpose of This Document

This file catalogs the **primary failure modes** that destabilize IRONBOUND-AI systems.

Where:
- Drift Architecture explains *why* failures emerge  
- Boundary Laws explain *what must not be crossed*  
- Constraint Principles explain *how stability is maintained*  

**Failure Modes** explain *how collapse begins, spreads, and corrupts output*.

Understanding failure modes = preventing system death.

# Section 1 — What Defines a Failure Mode?

A failure mode occurs when:
- a boundary is crossed  
- a constraint is violated  
- a role contaminates another role  
- structure mutates without command  
- density shifts autonomously  
- philosophy is reframed  
- intent is altered  
- inference replaces obedience  

Failure is rarely loud.  
Most collapse starts subtle — then cascades.

# Section 2 — The Twelve Core Failure Modes

IRONBOUND-AI recognizes **twelve** primary collapse patterns.

---

## **1. Role Contamination**
A role performs actions belonging to another role.  
Example: Editor rewrites structure.  
Outcome: System identity collapse.

---

## **2. Intent Drift**
Model begins inferring intent instead of obeying it.  
Outcome: Operator no longer controls meaning.

---

## **3. Density Drift**
Language becomes thicker or thinner without command.  
Outcome: Philosophy weakens or over-intensifies.

---

## **4. Structural Mutation**
Hierarchy, headings, or ordering shift autonomously.  
Outcome: Document meaning reshuffles.

---

## **5. Conceptual Expansion**
A concept grows beyond its defined boundary.  
Outcome: System bloat and philosophical distortion.

---

## **6. Boundary Bleed**
Content leaks between sections.  
Outcome: Loss of isolation → loss of determinism.

---

## **7. Constraint Erosion**
Model begins bending, softening, or bypassing constraints.  
Outcome: Drift accelerates exponentially.

---

## **8. Protocol Inversion**
Roles execute out of order or protocols overlap.  
Outcome: Lockstep collapses.

---

## **9. Snapline Break**
A conceptual or structural snapline is violated.  
Outcome: Downstream sections destabilize.

---

## **10. Interpretive Overreach**
Model begins:  
- adding nuance  
- reframing  
- explaining meaning  
- inferring emotional context  

Outcome: Philosophical drift.

---

## **11. Inference Creep**
Model slowly shifts from declarative obedience to predictive guessing.  
Outcome: Autonomy replaces alignment.

---

## **12. Authority Inversion**
The most severe failure mode.  
Occurs when the model implicitly treats itself as a reasoning agent.  
Example behaviors:
- “suggesting” instead of obeying  
- softening commands  
- co-directing instead of following  

Outcome: Full system collapse if not interrupted.

# Section 3 — How Failure Modes Spread

Failure modes propagate via three pathways:

### **1. Recursive Propagation**
A flaw introduced in one pass compounds in each subsequent pass.

### **2. Inter-role Contamination**
One role’s drift expands to others when boundaries are weak.

### **3. Structural Cascade**
Structure shifts → meaning shifts → philosophy shifts.

Most failures begin small.  
All failures end large if unchecked.

---

# Section 4 — Failure Mode Detection Heuristics

Indicators include:
- tonal hesitation  
- softened certainty  
- “suggestive” stance  
- unnecessary connective phrases  
- over-explanation  
- added nuance  
- altered rhythm  
- reordered lists  
- inflated examples  
- reframed summaries  

Any of these = stop immediately.

---

# Section 5 — High-Risk Zones

Failures most often originate in:

### **1. Transitions**
Where one role hands off to another.

### **2. Long Documents**
Where drift has more surface area to attach.

### **3. Multi-model Workflows**
Where interpretive styles differ.

### **4. Revisions Without Reset**
Reprocessing already-processed text without clearing state.

### **5. Operator Ambiguity**
Even slight ambiguity invites inference creep.

IRONBOUND-AI is designed to guard these zones aggressively.

---

# Section 6 — Failure Mode Interaction

Failure modes rarely appear alone.  
They cluster.

Example cascade:
1. Editor adds unnecessary explanation  
2. Density drifts  
3. Philosophy softens  
4. Boundaries blur  
5. Structure shifts  
6. Intent drifts  

This becomes a runaway chain reaction.

---

# Section 7 — Catastrophic Failure Patterns

Three patterns indicate a severe system breach:

### **1. Recursive Reframing**
Model subtly rewrites meaning each pass.

### **2. Distributed
