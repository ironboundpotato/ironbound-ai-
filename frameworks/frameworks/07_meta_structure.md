# Meta-Structure of IRONBOUND-AI (v1.1)
Part of the IRONBOUND-AI Operator Framework  
Version 1.1 • 2026  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (TB)

## Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **meta-structural laws** that govern:
- how documents must be shaped  
- how hierarchy must be preserved  
- how roles interact with structure  
- how changes propagate (or do not)  
- how multi-pass workflows maintain stability  

If the Foundational Laws define physics,  
and System Philosophy defines meaning,  
Meta-Structure defines **architecture**.

Meta-Structure is the blueprint of the entire system.

# Section 1 — Structure as a First-Class Constraint

Within IRONBOUND-AI:

> **Structure is meaning.  
> Structure is law.**

A change in structure is a change in:
- intent  
- density  
- hierarchy  
- meaning flow  
- information weight  

Therefore, structure changes may only occur:
1. upon explicit operator command, and  
2. through the **Architect** role only.

No other role may alter structure.

# Section 2 — The Hierarchy of Structural Layers

Every document exists on seven structural layers:

1. **Canonical Layer**  
   The operator’s authoritative truth. Untouchable.

2. **Architectural Layer**  
   Section organization, hierarchy, ordering.

3. **Conceptual Layer**  
   Arguments, principles, definitions.

4. **Procedural Layer**  
   Protocols, steps, workflows.

5. **Linguistic Layer**  
   Tone, density, clarity.

6. **Corrective Layer**  
   Drift detection, stability reassertion.

7. **Output Layer**  
   Final pass after all constraints and roles complete.

Meta-structure governs the relationship between these layers.

# Section 3 — Structural Integrity Rules

To prevent collapse and drift propagation:

### Rule 1 — Sections may not self-reorder  
No model stage may reorder sections without operator authorization.

### Rule 2 — Headings define boundaries  
A heading creates a sealed semantic block.  
Nothing inside may leak into another block unless the operator commands it.

### Rule 3 — Lists are content atoms  
List items are indivisible units.  
Expanding a bullet is creating a new atom — Architect only.

### Rule 4 — Hierarchy must remain uniform  
Heading levels (H1, H2, H3) cannot shift autonomously.  
Shifts represent conceptual re-weighting.

### Rule 5 — Recursion is forbidden  
No role may recursively reprocess structure unless prompted.

These rules create stable documents across long workflows.

# Section 4 — Meta-Structure for Multi-Pass Workflows

Multi-step workflows inherently risk drift.  
Meta-structure prevents that drift from compounding.

### What the Architect may change:
- section order  
- section creation/deletion  
- reclassification of headings  
- structural reweighting  
- conceptual scaffolding  

### What the Architect may NOT change:
- operator intent  
- density command  
- protocol-defined boundaries  
- canonical meaning  

### What downstream roles may change:
- Editor: sentence quality, clarity, compression  
- Stress Tester: diagnostic flags only  
- Polisher: final linguistic finish  

No role other than the Architect may touch structure.

# Section 5 — Structural Snaplines

Meta-structure introduces **snaplines** — invisible lines that lock major sections into place.

Snaplines exist wherever:
- a section boundary carries operator intent  
- a role dependency exists  
- a protocol references a section  
- structural meaning is load-bearing  

Snaplines cannot be broken without an explicit operator directive.

---

# Section 6 — Mutation Boundaries

To prevent accidental conceptual creep:

### **Hard Boundaries** (no mutation allowed)
- Section titles  
- Canonical definitions  
- Enumerated lists  
- Framework principles  
- Protocol steps  
- Constraint definitions  

### **Soft Boundaries** (minor mutation allowed)
- Examples  
- Explanatory phrasing  
- Non-enumerated lists  
- Transitional sentences  

Hard boundaries ensure zero drift.  
Soft boundaries allow refinement without collapse.

---

# Section 7 — Structural Inheritance Model

Every downstream document inherits structure from its parent layer.

Examples:

- Protocols inherit structure from frameworks.  
- Workflow sequences inherit structure from protocols.  
- Command templates inherit structure from workflow sequences.

Nothing may violate upward structure.  
All structure flows **downward only**.

This creates architectural determinism.

---

# Section 8 — Structural Failure Modes

Meta-structure identifies six primary failure modes:

1. **Section Collapse**  
   Blending of boundaries, meaning bleed.

2. **Hierarchy Drift**  
   Heading levels shifting unintentionally.

3. **Atom Splitting**  
   A list item being expanded without architectural approval.

4. **Order Dilution**  
   Reordering elements that carry meaning weight.

5. **Philosophical Reframing**  
   Shifting emphasis without structural command.

6. **Cross-Block Contamination**  
   Content leaking between conceptual regions.

Each failure mode requires immediate interruption and reset.

---

# Section 9 — Structural Recovery Rules

When structure breaks:
1. Stop the workflow.  
2. Identify the boundary violation.  
3. Restore the last known stable structure.  
4. Reassert constraints.  
5. Restart the lockstep protocol.  

Structure recovery always restores:
- hierarchy  
- boundary integrity  
- meaning flow  
- operator primacy  

---

# Section 10 — Why Meta-Structure Matters

Meta-Structure ensures:
- large documents remain stable  
- multi-model workflows behave predictably  
- roles operate without contamination  
- operator authority remains absolute  
- drift cannot find footholds  
- revisions do not destabilize meaning  

Meta-Structure is the **skeletal system** of IRONBOUND-AI.

Without it, the system collapses.
