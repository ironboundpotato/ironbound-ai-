# Drift Architecture of IRONBOUND-AI (v1.1)
Part of the IRONBOUND-AI Operator Framework  
Version 1.1 • 2026  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (TB)

## Purpose of This Document

This file defines the **Six-Demon Drift Architecture** — the conceptual model that explains  
how and why generative outputs deform over time.

Where protocols show *how* to interrupt drift, this framework shows:
- what drift is  
- why drift appears  
- how drift spreads  
- why drift compounds  
- what each type of drift destroys  

Drift is not an error.  
Drift is the **default evolutionary behavior** of generative systems.  
The operator’s role is to *interrupt* it before it reshapes meaning.

# Section 1 — What Drift Is

Drift is any **uncommanded deviation** from:
- intent  
- structure  
- density  
- tone  
- scope  
- confidence level  

Drift is not always obvious.  
Sometimes it hides inside:
- synonyms  
- rephrasings  
- tone adjustments  
- subtle structural changes  
- softening or strengthening density  
- inferred assumptions  

The Drift Architecture provides a diagnostic map to identify it.

# Section 2 — Why Drift Happens

Three forces cause drift:

### **1. Probabilistic Completion**
Models generate by predicting “likely continuations,”  
not by enforcing fidelity to operator intent.

### **2. Compression / Expansion Slippage**
A model may compact or expand ideas to maintain internal coherence.

### **3. Latent Prior Interference**
Patterns learned from training data intrude into the current task.

These forces distort:
- meaning  
- hierarchy  
- emotional weight  
- conceptual boundaries  

This distortion multiplies across revisions.

# Section 3 — The Six Demons of Drift (Core Architecture)

Each “Demon” represents a class of generative failure.

---

## **Demon 1 — Role Drift**
The model performs actions outside its assigned role.

Examples:
- Editor adds new ideas  
- Polisher restructures  
- Stress Tester fixes issues  
- Architect generates content  

Role Drift is catastrophic because it contaminates workflow boundaries.

---

## **Demon 2 — Tone Drift**
Tone becomes:
- softer  
- harsher  
- more emotional  
- more formal  
- more metaphorical  
- more conversational  

Tone Drift destroys *consistency* and breaks operator intent.

---

## **Demon 3 — Format Drift**
Format drifts when:
- bullets become paragraphs  
- lists are merged  
- markdown structure changes  
- hierarchy levels shift  
- spacing or layout changes  

Format Drift often hides structural drift inside stylistic changes.

---

## **Demon 4 — Intent Drift**
The model unconsciously redefines:
- purpose  
- constraints  
- task boundaries  
- outcome shape  

Intent Drift is the most dangerous form — it changes the *mission*.

---

## **Demon 5 — Scope Drift**
Scope expands or contracts beyond operator instructions.

Examples:
- adding examples  
- adding explanations  
- removing content  
- generalizing or specializing  
- widening or narrowing the task  

Scope Drift destabilizes density and structure simultaneously.

---

## **Demon 6 — Confidence Drift**
The model becomes:
- overly certain  
- overly cautious  
- more declarative  
- more hedged  
- more assertive  
- more passive  

Changes in confidence reshape the rhetorical weight of every statement.

Confidence Drift is subtle but pervasive.

# Section 4 — How Drift Propagates

Drift spreads through:

### **1. Recursive Error Multiplication**
A small deviation in one pass becomes a larger deviation in the next.

### **2. Density Mismatch**
Over-expansion in one area forces compression elsewhere, creating imbalance.

### **3. Hierarchy Destabilization**
A shift in structure causes meaning to shift under it.

### **4. Interpretive Substitution**
The model “fills in” missing pieces based on assumption instead of instruction.

### **5. Tone Resonance**
Shifts in emotional weight ripple through surrounding sections.

Drift never stays local.  
It always spreads.

---

# Section 5 — How Drift Hides

Drift may be concealed inside:
- synonyms  
- formatting changes  
- tone smoothing  
- added transitions  
- reorganized lists  
- reinterpreted constraints  
- implicit assumptions  

The most dangerous drift is the kind that “sounds correct.”

---

# Section 6 — Drift Detection Philosophy

The system trains the operator to look for:

### **1. Semantic Bloat**
More words than requested.

### **2. Conceptual Mutation**
Ideas not present in operator’s instructions.

### **3. Structural Distortion**
Hierarchy or section order adjusted without permission.

### **4. Density Creep**
Explanations becoming deeper or thinner.

### **5. Tone Slide**
Shift in emotional weight or formality.

### **6. Authority Inversion**
Model inferring tasks instead of waiting for instruction.

Detection relies on strict comparison against:
- operator command  
- previous stable output  
- structural template  
- density level  

---

# Section 7 — Drift Correction Philosophy

Drift is corrected by:
- explicit reset commands  
- constraint reinforcement  
- density resets  
- structural restorations  
- reissuing operator primacy macros  
- returning to last stable output  

The operator decides what version is canonical — not the model.

Drift correction is not moral judgment.  
It is **architectural maintenance**.

---

# Section 8 — Why Drift Architecture Matters

Understanding the Six Demons allows:
- clean multi-model coordination  
- predictable revisions  
- stable structural documents  
- zero-contamination role separation  
- drift isolation  
- error recovery  
- high-fidelity output at scale  

Drift Architecture is the **diagnostic backbone** of IRONBOUND-AI.

It empowers operator sovereignty by revealing the forces working against it.
