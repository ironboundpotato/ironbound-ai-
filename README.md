# IRONBOUND-AI
AI Systems Operator Toolkit • Drift-Controlled Architecture • Multi-Model Workflows  
Created by Kevin Gilbert (TB)  
Version: 1.0 • 2026  

## Overview

IRONBOUND-AI is a structured operator framework designed to stabilize large language models, mitigate generative drift, and coordinate multi-model workflows using clearly defined roles, constraints, and governance protocols.

This repository includes the complete Gilbert System, including:

- Six-Demon Drift Architecture v1.1  
- Seven Immutable Constraints v1.1  
- Bug Bomb Protocol v1.1  
- Operator Role System  
- Whitepaper v1.0  
- Attribution License (GAL 1.1)  

IRONBOUND-AI provides a consistent, repeatable method for producing high-integrity output when working with advanced language models in individual or multi-agent environments.

## Core Concepts (Summary)

### Six-Demon Drift Architecture
Defines six categories of generative instability:

1. Role Drift  
2. Tone Drift  
3. Format Drift  
4. Intent Drift  
5. Scope Drift  
6. Confidence Drift  

This structure provides a clear diagnostic framework for evaluating and correcting model output.

### Seven Immutable Constraints
A non-negotiable ruleset governing model behavior:

1. Role Integrity  
2. Declarative Boundaries  
3. Structural Obedience  
4. Intent Loyalty  
5. Format Consistency  
6. Correction Acceptance  
7. Human Primacy  

These constraints form the stabilizing backbone of the system.

### Bug Bomb Protocol v1.1
A multi-model workflow in which each model performs a specific role to ensure stability:

- Architect  
- Editor  
- Stress Tester  
- Polisher  

Each role is isolated to prevent cross-contamination and drift.

### Operator Role System
Formal definitions of operational roles and responsibilities within the multi-model workflow.

## Operator Quick-Start

To use the system immediately:

1. Review the materials in `core-principles/`  
2. Configure model output clarity to match task requirements  
3. Apply the Bug Bomb Protocol on the target task  
4. Diagnose drift using the Six-Demon model  
5. Apply appropriate constraints to resolve deviations  
6. Perform a final pass using the Polisher role  

This procedure produces consistent, verifiable output across models and tasks.
