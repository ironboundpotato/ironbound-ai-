# Core Principles — Overview
Part of the IRONBOUND-AI Operator Framework  
Version 1.0 • 2026  
Author: Kevin Gilbert (TB)

## Purpose of This Directory

The `core-principles/` directory contains the foundational laws, constraints, and conceptual structures that define the IRONBOUND-AI system.  
These files establish the non-negotiable rules that govern multi-model workflows, stabilize output, and prevent generative drift.

All downstream components — drift-governance, frameworks, protocols, and operator tools — depend on the principles defined here.

## What Core Principles Provide

1. A unified conceptual model for LLM behavior  
2. The governing laws for operator-model interaction  
3. The non-negotiable constraints required for stability  
4. The structural basis of the Six-Demon Drift Architecture  
5. The philosophical and functional spine of the entire system  

These principles ensure that advanced models operate within predictable boundaries and that operators maintain consistent control over output quality and structure.

## Contents of the Core Principles Folder

This directory will include:

- `00_overview.md` (this file)  
- `01_foundational_laws.md`  
- `02_constraints.md`  
- `03_conceptual_framework.md`  
- `04_operator_guidance.md`  

Additional documents may be added as the IRONBOUND-AI system evolves, but all must adhere to the Seven Immutable Constraints and the structural logic defined here.

## Integration with the IRONBOUND-AI System

The principles in this directory serve as:

- The **conceptual anchor** for the Six-Demon Drift Architecture  
- The **rule base** for the Seven Immutable Constraints  
- The **reference framework** for writing, evaluating, and correcting model output  
- The **philosophical layer** that ties the system together  

No protocol, workflow, or framework may contradict the principles defined in this directory.

## Usage

Operators should:

1. Begin here before working with any system components  
2. Understand the definitions and laws before applying tools  
3. Reference these principles when diagnosing drift or enforcing constraints  
4. Use this directory as the stable point-of-truth for all system behavior  

This directory defines **how the system thinks**, **why it works**, and **what cannot be violated.**
